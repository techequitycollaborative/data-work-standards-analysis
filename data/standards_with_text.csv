2 Contract Worker Disparity Project | Summary Report Executive Summary
Despite a worldwide pandemic that dramatically widened income inequality, pushed women out
of the workplace, and disproportionately harmed low-wage workers, the tech industry and its profits have
only grown. Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla and Facebook added a combined $2.9 trillion to their
collective market caps in 2021 and each has individually reached $1T or more in market cap in 2021 alone1. From
the biggest players in the market to future forecasted unicorns, there are no signs of slowing growth.
But the widespread perception that tech workers have prospered over the last 18 months isn’t a fully accurate
depiction. The reality is that many who work in tech—the temporary, contract, and contingent workers who
are classified differently from their directly-employed counterparts despite performing critical roles for the
companies—have been locked out of tech’s prosperity.
The prevalence and scale of contingent employment has grown steadily over the past several years, outpacing
direct employment at major companies like Google, which in March 2019 employed 121,000 contract workers
and 102,000 direct employees2. In the course of our research, TechEquity found evidence that contract
workers are less likely to benefit from the traditional pathways into the tech industry and are more likely to
belong to underrepresented racial, ethnic, and gender groups than the direct tech workforce.
The Contract Worker Disparity Project is a comprehensive look at the conditions that create these inequities.
Through a first-of-its-kind survey, first person interviews, and an in-depth literary and data review, we've
uncovered several key themes that typified the contract worker experience:
1. A dual management structure that prevents opportunity for advancement - Contingent workers
have a fragmented reporting structure: their day-to-day work is overseen by a manager at the
parent (tech) company while the operational aspects of their employment—pay, benefits, and legal
protections—are the purview of the staffing agency that hired them. These two management structures
rarely coordinate. Contractors reported that navigating this structure made it harder to do good work
and to advocate for themselves. Although this practice is set up to protect tech companies from liability,
it often leads to disempowerment for the worker.
2. Job precarity - Contracting roles typically start as a three- to six- month engagement and are extended
or terminated based on the whims of the parent company. Contract workers lack insight into why their
contracts may not be extended, and potential for their extension is tenuous and never guaranteed. At any
moment their role can be cut or they can be let go without warning, leaving them without an income or
protections.
3. A lack of voice in the workplace - Because of this precarity, which allows parent companies to not
renew contracts at any time for any reason, workers are afraid to speak up against workplace harassment
or other injustices. Additionally, they are concerned with being deemed “difficult to work with” as this
impedes their potential for contract extension or transition to direct employment.
4. Unequal pay for equal work - Contract workers are often performing the same job functions as
3 Contract Worker Disparity Project | Summary Report their directly-employed peers—but getting paid less for the same work. For example, 75% of software
developer contract workers who completed TechEquity’s survey are in the the 25th percentile or lower
for average earnings across the industry overall.
5. An overrepresentation of certain racial and gender groups in job classifications —otherwise
known as occupational segregation—with little power and comparatively low pay - In every dataset
that TechEquity examined, one fact was glaringly obvious—contract work in tech is disproportionately
done by people from under-represented racial, ethnic, and gender groups. Coupled with the lack of
representation in the direct tech workforce, the practice of contracting out sets the conditions for
occupational segregation.
Ultimately, these themes show heightened power differentials between contract and direct workers; contract
workers and staffing agencies; and contract workers and tech companies.
This report is a comprehensive account of TechEquity’s findings—issued throughout 2021 in four papers
on the working conditions, career mobility, business model, and worker demographics of the contract work
phenomena. Synthesizing public datasets, independent research, legal and regulatory landscapes, intel from
industry insiders, and hundreds of firsthand worker accounts, the findings make the case that while workers
value the opportunity to work in a desirable industry, corporate and policy changes are necessary to ensure
that the workers powering tech profits benefit from the industry’s growth.
A note on language
For brevity we’ve chosen some key words to refer to the contracting world.
When we say contract workers we are referring to any worker who is hired through a third-party
(vendor, staffing agency, or payroll company) but who performs their day-to-day work for a tech
company. This group of workers runs the gamut from low-wage service workers (like janitors and
security officers) to high-wage technical workers (like software engineers).
When we say contracting agencies we are including hiring agencies, staffing agencies, payroll
agencies, and vendors. When discussing the roles they play we will specify what type of agency,
but on a whole we are including all companies and agencies that act as a third-party to bring
contingent workers to the parent tech companies.

that do not have long-term funding.
A brief history of contract work in the U.S.
Contracting agencies have become deeply embedded in the American economy over the last several
decades. The practice of shifting portions of the labor force from direct employment to the payrolls of
contracting agencies began after World War II. The staffing industry billed itself as being able to fulfill
flexible, temporary roles with “ideal” employees—without the long-term commitment to an individual
worker of a family-sustaining income or other benefits. According to the American Staffing Association,
the practice of “contracting out” has been growing steadily—the industry closed out 2020 with a 175%
revenue increase4 over its 2003 total.
Contracting agencies (and what is often called temporary work) took off during the mid-twentieth
century with the concept of a “Kelly Girl5,” a housewife with “extra time on her hands” who was looking
for a foothold in the labor market at a time when direct employment was reserved for white men.
Job seekers likely to face discrimination in the workforce found a modicum of stability in substandard
employment arrangements, and the modern contract work model and its embedded inequity was born.
(Kelly Services remains a leader in today’s contract work/temporary work industry.)
7 Contract Worker Disparity Project | Summary Report There are three main ways these agencies function
inside of tech
• Staffing - A tech firm contracts with a staffing agency to supply the tech company with a
specific set of workers for a project, a division, or a type of work that the tech company is
not going to hire directly. Often these firms fill a range of roles including analysts, reception,
operations, content moderation, call centers, and so on.
• Payroll - A tech firm contracts with a payroll agency for the sole purpose of paying tech
company contractors and serving as the employer of record. The payroll agency will handle all
tax forms, direct deposit, legal compliance, and so on for the employee but does not provide
recruiting, management, or regular oversight.
• Service - A tech firm contracts with a service agency to provide a specific service and will also
hire, manage, and be responsible for all of the employees that provide that service. Service
agencies are also commonly referred to as vendors. Often vendors are janitorial companies,
landscaping services, cafeteria workers, etc. While vendor employees are not excluded from
TechEquity’s research, our findings are primarily based on the experiences of workers hired
through staffing or payroll agencies.

A 2008 study by BLS economists9 found that in the period from 1990-2008, employment in temporary
help services doubled, particularly in highly-skilled industries including tech. Conversely, as contracting

mathematical roles—just one of the types of roles that contract workers in tech fill—increased 41% from
2004-2008 alone while wages decreased 7.4%.

to the COVID-19 pandemic, the contracting agency industry ended 2020 having increased revenues

13 Contract Worker Disparity Project | Summary Report Connecting with workers + our major findings
To understand the worker experience, TechEquity interviewed over 30 current and former
contract workers, and ran a survey with 34 questions, with both qualitative and quantitative
responses (more information in the methodology section of this paper).
Across sources and surveys, certain findings are consistent:
• Contract workers of color are more likely to be paid hourly than annually, and to
receive lower pay than white workers: 39% of contractors of color are paid annually,
compared to 45% of white contractors with the majority of contractors of color earning in
the $50-85K range, compared to the majority of white contractors earning in the $85-120K
range.
• Contract workers of color are less likely to be converted to direct employment than
white contract workers: 41% of respondents who were people of color said they never
converted to direct employment compared to 31% of white respondents.
• Contract workers receive fewer benefits than direct tech workers: 33% of survey
respondents received no benefits, compared to just 23% of private-industry workers22 who
do not have paid vacation or sick leave.
• People of color are overrepresented in contract roles compared to the overall tech
workforce: 44% of contractors are people of color vs. 31% in the direct workforce.
Different outreach methodologies produced different results—on the pay, backgrounds, and
experiences of contract workers. The variations in responses points to the difficulty in sampling
vulnerable and underrepresented workers in a vast, homogenous industry. It also underscores the
need for public, vetted, and consistent datasets on this population.

survey results.

Contract workforce is significantly more diverse than
tech’s full-time workforce
Data and analysis from Project Include24 and TechEquity’s contract worker survey indicates that the
demographic trends of the contingent workforce at tech companies—those who are hired through and
employed by third-party entities, often on tenuous contracts—differ substantially from the directly employed
workforce.
Contract and temp workers are more likely to be Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian, women, and nonbinary
people than those hired in the direct workforce.
For every single racialized category, the rate of employment in contract work was greater than the rate of
employment of those same racialized groups in directly employed roles at the tech company. In short, contract
workers are the closest thing tech has to a diverse and representative workforce.

16 Contract Worker Disparity Project | Summary Report Source: TechEquity survey results and “Diversity in High Tech,” EEOC
These disparities also exist across gender. According to our in-house survey, 60% of survey respondents were
women and 5.8% nonbinary, genderqueer, or gender fluid; 32% were men.
Reliable data on the number and rates of gender-expansive people in America are still emerging, with one
recent study26 finding there to be 1.2 million nonbinary people, or 0.004% of the total U.S. population,
while other data indicate that 5% of startup workers are nonbinary27—though this doesn’t incorporate the
employees who chose not to answer to protect their privacy.
Direct employment opportunities are not the only area where workers of color, women, and nonbinary people
experience disparate treatment. Preliminary data and contract workers’ descriptions of their job functions
support assertions that they perform similar work as direct employees—for a fraction of the pay.
17 Contract Worker Disparity Project | Summary Report Source: TechEquity survey results

To the extent that tech has diversified since 2014, it has done so by keeping its direct employee statistics in
stasis while disproportionately hiring people of color, women, and nonbinary workers into lower-paying, more
precarious contract roles that offer much less opportunity for career advancement.

In practice, reporting to two entities leaves workers without the support they need to perform their roles.
Myriad actors working together from separate offices requires timely and coordinated communication, as
well as regular training for tech managers to understand how to supervise hybrid teams of direct and contract
workers. Many of the workers we interviewed detailed that they reported to a series of tech managers during
their contracts, with many stepping into the role with seemingly minimal knowledge of the unique legal and
company rules that applied to their direct reports. This results in inconsistency in how well the tech managers
and the hiring agencies work together to employ the contract workers.

Louisa's Story
Louisa* (name changed for anonymity) accepted a position working on public policy at a major
tech company. She learned quickly, however, that the duties her contracting agency hired her
to fulfill actually conflicted with the tech company’s internal rules precluding her from certain
activities critical to her job, such as speaking on behalf of the company and managing relationships
with external partners. Despite numerous requests to her tech manager to clarify how she should
navigate the company’s internal rules and still fulfill her role, Louisa received no guidance. She
was assigned ad hoc tasks, but was never given a clear metric for how she could meet or exceed
expectations. She sensed that her first manager didn’t understand how to apply the company’s
contractor policies well enough to revise Louisa’s job scope.
Adding to her difficulties, that manager was later replaced with someone who had even less
information on Louisa’s role. Louisa then had to rebuild the relationship with the person who could
extend her contracts and help her convert to direct employment—without a clear sense of what
management needed from her in the first place.

Contract work limits job mobility across the career ladder
Beyond mobility limitations from contract to direct employee, contract workers face strict policies and
procedures that limit their future job searches. The majority of workers who spoke to TechEquity told us
that they were not supposed to list or reference the tech company on their resumes or job applications.
Instead, they were instructed to say, for example, “Recruiting Manager for Pro Unlimited [contracting
company] at Uber [tech company].”
One worker shared that their contract experience actually put them at a disadvantage for direct
employment opportunities. During the interview process for a full-time tech role at a different company,
a hiring panel saw contract employment on their resume and pivoted to discussing other contract work
opportunities, instead of the full-time position for which
they had applied.
Told to downplay their connection to the tech
companies, contract workers either comply and suffer the
hiring disadvantages, or go against corporate instructions
to gain some benefit from their work experiences. Many
contract workers reported doing the latter. It’s a gamble
with consequences: recruiters confirmed to TechEquity
that those who decide to list the tech companies as
their employers are passed over or disadvantaged for
other contract work openings.

Dat's Story
Dat* (name changed for anonymity) was excited to make a career pivot into working for a tech
start-up, having always wanted to be a part of a small team of ambitious but down-to-earth
colleagues. What they found, however, was a new version of the old boys club.
“It was always so uncomfortable. I always felt like there was such a divide. I
thought that, ‘oh well eventually they’re going to hire me on permanently, or
eventually the team is going to warm up to me.’ But no, I always felt like an
outsider.”
The final straw came when Dat was prevented from attending the company’s remote retreat—
which Dat had planned. Not only did they miss out on the four-figure bonus that everyone else
received, they missed out on a formative bonding experience with their colleagues. “At that point I
was just like, ‘oh, I will never be a part of this team. Like ever.’” Dat’s company ended their contract
less than a year later. A former colleague later shared with Dat that their contract was ended

32 Contract Worker Disparity Project | Summary Report Everyone loses when labor practices amplify instability. Research on the effects of income inequality points
to its role in slowing economic growth37, accelerating segregation38, and destabilizing democracy39 across
the globe. Its most direct, material effect is, of course, economic oppression that lessens quality of life for
everyone. America’s largest corporations and industries of concentrated wealth play an outsized role in
contributing to economic destabilization—and in fixing it. Contract work is one facet of the degradation of job
classifications that includes gig and piecework. In light of the 1999 lawsuit against Microsoft for its illegal use of
“permatemps” to avoid paying stock options, health insurance, and retirement benefits40, and more recent news
about the prevalence of the contingent workforce powering tech profits, it becomes clear that while temp
practices did not originate in the sector, they are being applied in tech to incredibly harmful ends in ways that
are likely to affect other industries.
If we take the proliferation of gig work after the Great Recession as a signal of what’s to come, tech’s contract
workforce could be on the precipice of considerable growth as we enter a period of economic recovery. As we
enter an era characterized by increasing inequality, we need to ensure that workers re-entering the workforce
through temp work are not being exploited and that these roles can lead to safe, stable, secure careers.

Require family-sustaining pay and benefits
When it comes to ensuring quality pay and benefits for contract workers, tech companies have more power
than they realize. The staffing and temp agencies that compete for a lucrative contract with a tech company
are usually only required to specify their bill rate in their Requests for Proposal—leaving critical wage and
benefits decisions up to the agency. This means wage rates, titles, benefit offerings, paid time off, career
supports, and more are left unseen and unscrutinized by tech companies, giving room to agencies to grow
their profits at the expense of contract workers.
This gives tech companies the opportunity to require higher standards for worker treatment in their vendor
selection process, and raise the bar for working conditions at their company and across the industry.
What tech companies can do
• Require vendors to provide at minimum a living wage41 for the area in which a contract worker lives or
works.
• Ensure that employees are offered medical, vision, and dental benefits that reflect the minimum value
and affordability threshold42 that is offered to direct employees.
• Demonstrate a commitment to employee wellness by ensuring adequate paid time off (PTO) and
parental leave programs43. For workers with part-time or contract time limits, use a formula to calculate
pro-rated PTO that would be equivalent to directly-employed workforce PTO benefit.
• Provide transparency about the terms and conditions of assignments with written notice from the
staffing agency that includes: the length of the assignment, safety requirements, certifications, or
personal protective equipment needed for a work assignment, the specific criteria for transitioning
to permanent employment, and the “spread” between the temp worker’s hourly wage and the hourly
charge to the tech (or parent/client) company for their labor. (From Temps in Tech NELP and TWJ
Report44)
• Ensure that agencies use clear contract timelines that include written details of when a contract will be
evaluated for renewal, evaluation criteria for renewal, and provide any details on what employees must
do to initiate the renewal process.
• Prohibit contract terms that limit temp workers’ opportunities to obtain permanent employment at a
tech (or parent/client) company—or accept employment with a competitor company. (From Temps in
Tech NELP and TWJ Report)
• Implement best practices for predictable scheduling45 and apply components of fair workweek laws46 and
current California law for scheduling47 across the contract workforce.
36 Contract Worker Disparity Project | Summary Report 2.
Compensate workers with equal pay for equal work
Contract workers are integral to the success of tech companies. They are moderating content,
conducting research, launching marketing campaigns, planning events, and so much more—often
side-by-side with full-time employees. However, these workers—disproportionately Black, Indigenous,
brown, women, and nonbinary48—are often paid lower wages and benefits than their directly-employed
counterparts. Tech companies must ensure that all of their workers are being valued and paid for the
work they do, not just the ones on direct payroll.
What tech companies can do
• Require reports from staffing agencies that include pay rate by job type; tech companies are
already required to report this information49 to state agencies and should be evaluating their
contract workforce against their directly-employed workforce to ensure that they are not
enacting unequal pay for equal work.
• Create a clear and transparent process—that is provided in writing to contract workers—to
request, approve, and process raises for contract workers.
• During the Request for Proposal bid process—and routinely as an audit practice—tech companies
should ensure that staffing agencies provide equivalent plans for employer-sponsored healthcare
to all contract workers.
• Implement equitable hiring practices50 for direct and contract employees including publishing pay
rates in all job descriptions51 and prohibiting the request for salary history52 in the application,
interview, or offer stages for a candidate.
37 Contract Worker Disparity Project | Summary Report 3.
Develop protocols to report workplace safety violations
and protect contract worker voices
Contract workers are routinely faced with a painful choice between speaking up about abuse and keeping
their jobs. Because contract workers rely on contract renewals to maintain economic security, they often feel
unable to report workplace harassment and toxic environments.
Without protection against retaliation, contract workers have no avenue to improve their conditions and tech
companies have no idea what really goes on in their workplaces. Tech companies must use their power to
provide safe, non-retaliatory means for contract workers to raise concerns and create accountability for all
responsible parties.
What tech companies can do
• Develop an independent complaint process, led by contract workers and/or worker organizations, that
allows contract workers to confidentially file complaints that are investigated—ideally by a third party—
and if complaints are found to be valid, take responsibility to ensure that workers are made whole as a
result.
• Publish and report the abuses of staffing agencies53 to the relevant regulatory body to ensure that the
staffing agency is held accountable for wrongdoing.
• Outline in writing to vendors that the company supports workers' right to organize, to utilize protected
concerted activity54, and encourages the voluntary recognition of unionization efforts.
• Allow contract workers to attend All-Hands meetings and be included in other all-staff communication
channels where employees are able to receive and respond to company news and important health and
safety updates.
38 Contract Worker Disparity Project | Summary Report 4.
Implement equitable procurement practices
As the contracting structure currently stands, it’s remarkably easy for staffing agencies to take an enormous
cut of their agreements with tech companies for their own profit. During procurement and in subsequent
invoices, staffing agencies often only provide a flat bill rate to the tech company; this enables the agency to
charge undisclosed amounts for their agency fee and overhead, while paying the worker less than what the
tech company may have intended for the worker to receive.
This lack of transparency hurts the workers and the tech company alike. The contract workers are getting paid
a mere fraction of what the company is paying for them, creating a situation of exploitation for the workers,
and an opaque financial investment for the company. Tech companies have significant leverage with staffing
agencies and can utilize that power to improve the wages, benefits, and working conditions of contract
workers—not to mention, improve their return on investment and make wiser long-term financial decisions.
What tech companies can do
• Require an itemized breakdown within RFPs of agency fees for service (sometimes referred to as
“markups”), wage rates, benefits options and employee co-pays, recruiting methods, mentorship
opportunities, retention rates, HR protocols, complaint procedures, etc.
• Require that all vendors and staffing agencies provide detailed assignments to all workers that include
pay rate, benefit options and employee contribution, paid time off, HR protocols, complaint procedures,
location of assignment, hourly schedule, and agency fees or “markups” for service.
• Change internal policy to allow for procurement officers to take other factors into account besides cost
and competence when making contracting decisions
• Align RFP review processes to align with best practices for fair chance hiring55 to ensure a more inclusive
talent pool; do not work with agencies that implement non-compete practices.
39 Contract Worker Disparity Project | Summary Report 5.
Outline and publish clear pathways to
direct employment
Even though contract workers contribute to the success of their tech company, they’re often barred from
reaping the benefits of that work. Most tech companies create a firewall between contract roles and full-time
opportunities, leaving contract workers on the outside. Given that contract workers are disproportionately
from racial and gender groups that are under-represented in tech, this practice creates harm, furthering the
racial wealth gap.
By creating real pathways to direct employment, tech companies are not only giving their contract workers
a chance at opportunity and security, they’re also opening themselves up to a diverse and experienced talent
pool.
What tech companies can do
• End the gag order on contract workers56 and allow them to list their experience working at the tech
company on their resume; stop the practice of penalizing workers (in the form of not extending or
renewing their contracts) who do so.
• Systematize hiring practices that allow contract workers to access internal job boards and acknowledge
their previous work and contribution to the company, similar to how internal candidates would be
considered with condensed application requirements and shorter review windows.
• End policies that disincentivize contract worker mobility (non-competes, high fees for conversion) and
adopt the incentives provided to direct workers, including hiring bonuses for those who successfully
recruit contract workers. Existing policies demonstrate that tech companies understand the rationale
behind internal referral systems, offering several-thousand dollar bonuses for successful referral hires57.
These policies, replicated for teams or managers who successfully hire former contract workers, would
also improve the mobility and stability of tech’s entire workforce.
• Offer training and professional development opportunities to contract workers. If there are minimum
standards for tuition reimbursement provided, do a regular audit of the staffing agencies to ensure those
benefits are being distributed and applied correctly.

Improve transparency for workers, companies,
shareholders, and the public
Tech companies hold significant influence in the global economy. Their actions—whether in product
development, company acquisition, privacy, or labor rights—have ripple effects throughout our society.
By being transparent about their actions, tech companies can ensure that their actions are in-line with their
values and their commitments to shareholders, workers, and the public. Sharing the outcomes of these
policies helps ensure that tech company’s written policies and stated commitments are correctly applied by
the staffing agencies they employ. Tech companies have an opportunity to set an example, to demonstrate
what it means to be a responsible actor within the industry and the broader economy. Through establishing
transparency and accountability, tech companies can be leaders in ensuring fair treatment for all workers.
What tech companies can do
• Publish standards for vendors and staffing agencies that includes high-road practices and accountability
mechanisms for the vendors and the tech company itself.
• Publish a list of the vendors and agencies with which they work, as well as aggregate data on workers
hired through third parties including racial, gender, and pay demographics in addition to years with the
company and classification.
• Include contract data in annual DEI reports—disaggregating pay, race, gender, and other important
equity factors from contractor to direct employee; as well as listing which vendors they are employing.
• Make reports to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and other relevant state agencies public and easily
accessible to workers, shareholders, and the public.
• Conduct an annual audit of staffing agencies and vendors to ensure that stated commitments and
written policies of the tech company are being implemented and applied to the contract workers
themselves. When staffing agencies do not comply, ensure that there is a clear policy for those violations
that includes dropped contracts, fines, and any other mechanisms that are appropriate to internal policy
violation repercussions.

Public Policy
Improving working conditions and ending wage disparities will require policy and regulatory reform.
Throughout the Contract Worker Disparity Project, workers have been consistent about what needs to change:
equal pay for equal work, greater stability, and better working conditions.
42 Contract Worker Disparity Project | Summary Report Policy Solutions
Compensate workers with equal pay for equal work
Workers fulfilling reasonably similar job responsibilities for the same company should earn the same wages,
regardless of classification. The federal Equal Pay Act requires that people of different genders, race, and
other characteristics must earn equal pay for equal work. The 1963 legislation, as well as many of the efforts to
strengthen it at the state level, has adopted new provisions to extend protections to those doing substantially
similar work instead of equal work, yet few have amended the same establishment or same workplace language
in a way that would protect contract workers. Amending the federal and state Equal Pay Acts is one way to
reign in the significantly different wages that certain workers earn—compared to others working for the same
parent company—solely because of who holds their employment agreements.
Ensure safe and secure employment
The fact that many existing labor laws do not acknowledge the unique facets of contract work or adequately
protect contract workers is part of the reason the practice is burgeoning, and that working conditions are
often so poor. Contract workers must have written information about their job assignments, clear personnel
policies and protections, clear contract terms, formal contract extension and cancellation processes, written
and accessible pathways to conversion to direct employment, the ability to speak plainly and openly about their
work histories, and more.
Federal bills including the Restoring Worker Power Act58 from 2020 outline what a worker-centered temporary
worker bill of rights could contain. From receiving little to no written information about their job assignments,
contract terms that are frequently in flux and subject to abrupt cancellation, and scant benefits to no
meaningful ability to speak up on the job,
contract workers need dedicated and
clear worker protections.
43 Contract Worker Disparity Project | Summary Report Bring transparency to the contract workforce
Measures that create public data and give workers the ability to combat pay disparities are critical. Right
now, the relationships between tech companies and contracting agencies are a black box. Even the tech
companies don’t know exactly how much some contract workers earn or the specifics of their employment
agreements. Traditional workforce reporting processes, including the federal EEO-159 and BLS60 reports, let
contracting agencies hide the scale of the problem, by decoupling the workers from their parent companies
in ways that prevent contract-worker-to-direct-worker comparisons. To understand the scope and inherent
disparities of limited duration contracts, public agencies must collect granular information on worker earnings,
demographics, and company placements disaggregated by worker classification. Requiring that the data come
from the parent companies via the contracting agencies would also disrupt the practice that shields companies
from the personnel decisions made by contracting agencies and lets corporations deny responsibility for wage
and demographic disparities.
Here, the Restoring Worker Power Act again offers one model for how contracting and parent company
reporting could look. Locally, recent legislative proposals including California’s 2021 Worker Metrics61 bill also
seek to reveal the contours of the contingent workforce.
Across the country, workers are organizing for more transparency and protections in the contingent workforce.
TechEquity Collaborative is working with workers, advocates, labor, researchers, and others to advance policy
solutions for contract worker justice in California.

47 Contract Worker Disparity Project | Summary Report Methodology
Origin of the Contract Worker Disparity Project research
The Contract Worker Disparity project stemmed from an earlier project in which TechEquity and Silicon Valley
Rising examined the harms that low-wage service workers, like janitors and security officers, experience at tech
companies. However, another trend began to emerge; there was another class of worker contracted through
an employment agency, brought on for short-term contracts (that often, ultimately, lasted for long periods of
time). These workers did work similar to direct employees of the tech company from marketing and product
management, to event planning, admin work and even software development and beyond. These workers were
classified as temporary workers, vendors, or contract workers, and anecdotal evidence showed that these
workers were paid less, received fewer benefits, and were living in a world of contract precarity. Additionally,
early evidence showed that these workers were often members of underrepresented racial, ethnic, and gender
groups. Thus, the impetus for the Contract Worker Disparity project was born.
Primary factors in contract work research
Contract work is an under-researched area with complex factors at play. Ultimately, there are limits to the
amount of data that can be collected without companies voluntarily reporting the data or a public disclosure
requirement in place.
• Privacy and anonymity - Contract workers do not always have protection against retaliation should they
speak out against their direct employers or the tech companies for which they are contracted. Therefore,
it was our priority to ensure their privacy and anonymity throughout the life of the project unless they
specified the desire to have their story shared publicly. If they did, those participants were asked to sign
an agreement indicating what they were willing to share publicly with their name or likeness associated
with content used in the project deliverables.
• Definition of tech worker - TechEquity defines a tech worker as anyone who is working at a tech
company or anyone who has a tech position at any company. In our experience, tech workers might
be working in an industry other than “big tech” with a similar title, but not consider themselves a tech
worker. For example, a customer success manager working at a healthcare startup may not consider
themselves a traditional “tech worker.” We tried to capture the varied experiences of tech workers across
a number of industries to understand the landscape of the contract worker experience.
48 Contract Worker Disparity Project | Summary Report • Function of staffing agencies - There are three main ways these agencies function inside of tech:
# Staffing - A tech firm contracts with a staffing agency to supply the tech company with a specific
set of workers for a project, a division, or a type of work that the tech company is not going to hire
directly. Often these firms fill a range of roles including analysts, reception, operations, content
moderation, call centers, and so on.
# Payroll - A tech firm contracts with a payroll agency for the sole purpose of paying tech company
contractors and serving as the employer of record. The payroll agency will handle all tax forms,
direct deposit, legal compliance, and so on for the employee but does not provide recruiting,
management, or regular oversight.
# Service - A tech firm contracts with a service agency to provide a specific service and will also hire,
manage, and be responsible for all of the employees that provide that service. Service agencies are
also commonly referred to as vendors. Often vendors are janitorial companies, landscaping services,
cafeteria workers, etc. While vendor employees are not excluded from TechEquity’s research, our
findings are primarily based on the experiences of workers hired through staffing or payroll agencies.
• Representation and sample size - We recognize that there is variability across tech companies,
industries, company size, and how they rely on third-party labor. The same variability applies to the
employment agencies that provide this labor. Our research showed a wide range in individual experience,
primarily dependent on a contract worker’s relationship to their tech company manager, their position
and title, and if their contract was held by the tech company, or by a staffing a contracting agency and
their position and title.
• Publicly available data and comparative survey data - There is little to no publicly available data
to capture a directly-employed tech worker’s experience in the industry, making it difficult to create
a benchmark. There is no single set of data to capture their salaries, benefits, or any equalizing
measurements to ensure title parity from company to company. Additionally, there is no disaggregated
data about contract labor in tech, nor any studies that capture the experience or sentiment of contract
workers in tech. The Bureau of Labor Statistics collects some demographic data about workers across
many sectors, including temp work. But because BLS tracks what contract workers do— not necessarily
the employer or industry for which they do it—people who work on contract in operations, marketing,
administrative services, etc. within tech are invisible in the data. The lack of data also conceals just how
many tech companies rely on agencies to fill their staffing needs. TechEquity’s work is the most recent
comprehensive report (that we are aware of) that begins to capture this information. TechEquity
research indicated that contracting practices are widespread (and increasing) in tech as well as other
industries—yet the exact scale and disparities are invisible without a mandated, comprehensive approach
to capturing, categorizing, and analyzing contract worker employment data.
49 Contract Worker Disparity Project | Summary Report Research
First person interviews
Our research began with an effort to understand the contracting landscape and discern the varying
experiences of workers with a temporary, vendor, or contractor distinction, which we refer to as contract
workers as a shorthand to capture the variability of their employment. We interviewed 30 people sourced
through TechEquity’s network.
Survey results
Over a six month period of time, TechEquity Collaborative administered and collected data from a 34-question
survey. We sent out survey response requests using social media, through chain referrals, our in-house
newsletter, and email outreach, and word of mouth. Our in-house survey received 287 responses, with a
significant percentage of respondents identifying as Asian, Black, Indigenous, and Latinx people, women, trans
and nonbinary people, and people who hold more than one of these identities. Our goal for the total number
of respondents was 500 survey takers to ensure statistical significance of responses and analysis. Because the
threshold was not met over a six month period, we expanded it to include a paid survey administered through
a surveying instrument called Quest Mindshare, a global leader in providing opt-in online survey samples.
For the paid survey, potential respondents were asked if they worked in the IT/Tech industry as opt-in criteria.
A total of 1,909 emails were sent to potential survey takers who said they worked in tech/IT. Only respondents
who passed the screener questions of currently or previously working in a contract, vendor, or temporary tech
position proceeded with the survey. There were a total of 512 survey responses. All respondents received an
incentive for completing the survey.
Initially, no demographic quotas were set in order to understand the organic sample of this population. After a
30% soft launch, a gender quota was set in order to ensure a representative sample of women.
In addition to our own survey tools, we incorporated data from the Project Include Harassment Report, HR+A’s
Tech’s Racial Equity Gap report, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and EEOC’s Diversity in High Tech
special report from 2014.
50 Contract Worker Disparity Project | Summary Report Survey and research limitations
As previously mentioned, survey data specifically informing contract worker experiences in any industry is
limited and difficult to obtain, requiring us to run our own surveys to collect a representative sample of worker
experiences. We ran both an in-house survey (disseminated through TechEquity’s network) and a paid survey.
The two instruments elicited responses from a demographically distinct set of workers. When drawing the
conclusions found in the report, we looked at the two datasets together.
Literature review
The matter of the proliferation of contract work in tech specifically has been written about frequently in recent
years—in sources including the Guardian, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, KQED—but studied little. To
begin TechEquity’s study, we reviewed existing coverage as well as labor and data reports. The media coverage
informed our understanding of the trends, key players, and common contract work practices. Paired with
our conversations with workers, we took that information and assessed it against Bureau of Labor Statistics
(BLS) data and reports on “temporary help services” to understand the scale, revenue trends, and placement
classifications in the staffing agency industry. Our demographic analysis relied on analysis of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission “Diversity in High Tech” report; the findings of that report informed
TechEquity’s knowledge of the demographics of tech’s direct workforce. To situate our findings within the
picture of American labor, we reviewed historical analysis and research from the National Employment Law
Project, Economic Policy Institute, and The Temp Economy: From Kelly Girls to Permatemps in Postwar
America by Erin Hatton.

1. PPPPLLLLAAAATTTTFFFFOOOORRRRMMMM:::: Here, the term ‘platform’ is used to refer to a ‘cloudwork platform’
(Woodcock and Graham 2020). Cloudwork platforms are one of two broad types of
‘digital labour platforms’. There are two points of note here. First, a ‘digital labour
platform’ is a company that uses digital resources to mediate value-creating
interactions between consumers and individual service-providing workers, i.e. that
digitally mediates transactions of labour. Digital platforms like Airbnb or eBay—
where goods are exchanged—are not included within this de6nition. Second, among
digital labour platforms, there are two broad types. In the 6rst—’geographically-
tethered’ or ‘location-based’ platforms—the work is required to be done in a
particular location (e.g. delivering food from a restaurant to an apartment or driving a
person from one part of town to another). In contrast, in the second—’cloudwork’
platforms—the work can, in theory, be performed from anywhere via the internet (e.g.
data categorisation or online freelancing). In these principles, the term ‘platform’
refers only to the second category of cloudwork platforms.
2. WWWWOOOORRRRKKKKEEEERRRR:::: People who 6nd work through platforms, regardless of their employment
status (e.g. employees or independent contractors).
3. CCCCOOOONNNNTTTTRRRRAAAACCCCTTTTSSSS:::: All written agreements between parties about the terms of the work
including terms and conditions. These may be signed in-person or electronically.

1. As a guideline for ensuring non-payment is not an option, see criteria developed by Harmon and Silberman in
their 2018 ‘Rating working conditions on digital labour platforms’, as follows:
In cases where rejection mechanisms exist for delivered work:
Workers should be able to contest rejection decisions.
Workers receive a clear and reasonable explanation for any rejections
Workers may attempt to redo rejected work at least once
If the worker contests the rejection decision, the case is reviewed (a second time) by a neutral third party,
who makes a binding decision; the platform agrees not to punish the worker in any way if the third party
decides in favor of the worker
If the work is rejected it is not able to be used by the client.
2. This can be evidenced either through a policy, or by provision of aggregated earnings data. The ‘vast majority’ of
workers is understood as 85% or more of all workers engaged on the platform. This is in recognition of the fact that
all the time between when a worker starts and submits a task may not necessarily be working time.We compare
worker’s piece-work earnings against minimum wages based on UK government guidelines. The calculation is as
follows:
Number of tasks of a given kind completed by workers on average per hour = A
This number is divided by 1.2 to calculate A*, an estimated average number of tasks completed per hour that
accounts for the disadvantage that relatively inexperienced workers face.
Therefore, A* = 0.83A
Local minimum hourly wage = M,
This 6gure varies across jurisdictions.
Where a jurisdiction’s laws do not specify a minimum wage, a reasonable alternative can be used.
Fair piece rate corresponding to the minimum wage = F = (M ÷ 0.83A).
This calculation must be repeated across task types. To receive this point, platforms operating on a piece-work
model must demonstrate that 85% or more of workers on their platform earn more than F per hour in each task
type.
3. This could include regular guaranteed hours, managed supply and demand, or minimum and maximum hours.
4. To ful6l this criterion, platforms must have clear policies about what kind of data is collected from workers, when
it is collected, how long it is kept, and how it is processed. They must take responsibility of data handling, storing
and management processes, and ensure that personal data is kept safe and secure and is not sold or shared with
third parties, without workers’ speci6c consent.
https://fair.work/en/fw/principles/cloudwork-principles/ Page 4 of 6 Fairwork | Cloudwork (Online Work) Principles 10/3/25, 11:34 AM
5. The platform shall encourage clients to adopt working time arrangements that are consistent with the
contractual terms of the worker-client relationship. While workers may be required to meet project deadlines or to
attend meetings, in the absence of an employment relationship, the platform shall discourage clients from
unreasonably interfering with a worker’s ability to choose their own working time schedule.
6. When a worker drops out from an ongoing job, this does not punitively impact their rating or reputation if it is for
a reasonable cause, or if the worker leaves the job before it started and if the requester has been given suhcient
notice. Platforms might choose to categorise, 6lter and order inactive pro6les without directly changing their
reputation score or rating on the platform.
7. The platform publicly commits to support any effort by its workers to collectively organise or form a trade union.
This could be done by, for instance, adding the following text in their contracts: “[company] will support any effort
by its workers to collectively organise or form a trade union. Collective bargaining through trade unions can often
bring about more favourable working conditions”. Platforms are also required to provide a directory of international
labour unions and confederations and advocates to workers on request.
8. An example is the German Trade Union IG Metall’s Ombuds Ohce, which arbitrates disputes between workers
and platforms that have signed up to the Crowdsourcing Code of Conduct

MODERATION: OUTSOURCING
ACCOUNTABILITY
Content moderation is a vital operation that keeps
digital platforms usable, but instead of handling it
in-house, major tech companies typically offload
the work to third-party firms – Business Process
Outsourcing companies (BPOs). This creates a
complex, layered system where global platforms
delegate content moderation to outsourcing firms,
distancing themselves from direct accountability.
The biggest players requiring content moderation
include:
• Alphabet (YouTube, Google Search Engine,
Maps)
• Amazon (Twitch, Amazon.com)
• ByteDance (TikTok)
• Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp)
• Microsoft (LinkedIn, Xbox Live, other
platforms)
• X (formerly Twitter)
While BPOs may hold the contracts, the core
aspects of content moderation – such as training
protocols, review policies, moderation tools and
performance metrics – are largely determined by
the tech companies themselves. This arrangement
allows platforms to maintain operational control
while distancing themselves from direct respon-
sibility for working conditions. In several cases,
when workers have raised concerns or attempted
to organize, the response has included threats to
shift contracts to other jurisdictions, limiting their
ability to advocate for improved standards

While content moderators endure graphic and
distressing material daily, they lack the workplace
protections afforded to other trauma-exposed
professions. Here’s how different sectors address
psychological hazards:
Profession & location Protections
Mandatory psychological debriefing after critical incidents, peer support programmes and access to
long-term mental health care. There are many mental training programmes available to personnel,
including critical incident stress management (CISM), critical incident stress debriefing (CISD), peer
support, mental health first aid and Road to Mental Readiness (R2MR). These exist to minimize the
impact of stressors on personnel.

THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE SCREENS: WHY TECH COMPANIES NEED NEW PROTOCOLS FOR SAFE CONTENT MODERATION 15 CONCLUSION:
A CALL TO ACTION
Many content moderators take deep pride in
their work – protecting children, shielding fellow
citizens from harm, and upholding the integrity
of digital public spaces. Like first responders,
they perform difficult and often invisible work for
the public good. They deserve the same dignity,
recognition and protection we afford to others
doing society’s most vital jobs.
AI can support moderation, but it cannot replace
human judgement. Only people can navigate the
cultural, linguistic, and ethical complexities needed
to assess harm and context.
For the first time, tech firms and the BPOs in their
supply chains have clear, evidence-based guid-
ance on how to achieve this: by adopting the Eight
Protocols for Sustainable Content Moderation.
At the center of these protocols are freedom of
association and collective bargaining – tools that
empower workers to shape the conditions under
which they labour.
If there is no action, then we – as users of these
platforms – must raise our collective voices to
stand with the people who shield us from the
unimaginable. It’s time to stand with the people
behind the screens.

Building Better Workplaces for Data Workers,Aapti Institute; Karya,datawork.aapti.in,Standards,NGO/non profit (other),Data workers,India,,aapti.pdf,"Stage 01
The first stage serves as a checklist and roadmap for addressing documented precarities surrounding data workers.
The standards make recommendations on how data workers’ contracts are arranged, workers’ freedom to pursue aid
and redressal as per regulations, their ability to earn, the design of their working environments, required safety
measures, and termination processes. Compliance with local regulations and this first stage of standards will create
basic safety and stability for workers involved in data generation and enrichment.
Decent contracts
Contracts’ designs can create risks and strain for workers. These problems arise from contractual practices like short
contract durations, excessive non-disclosure measures, and inadequate information on topics like workflows, the
downstream use of datasets, and the potential hazards for workers. Companies can design and administer contracts
that inform workers about their roles, avoid potentially harmful constraints, and provide paid work for substantial
periods of time.
01
Easy to understand
Contract contents should be written in a way that most people can understand and should be available in languages
workers are proficient in.
02
Minimum contract duration
Companies' worker contracts cannot have engagement periods of less than three months.
03
Clear information in the contract
Workers' contracts should include key information about key topics like compensation calculation, the role’s
requirements and processes, the metrics and information collected about them, the hazards and risks involved, and
all policies related to termination, promotion, and social support and benefits.
Auxiliary standard: Companies managing data workers need to minimize vagueness and open-endedness
surrounding worker’s roles, the workflows, and company expectations. As workers are introduced to new work and
roles, they should be provided clear, updated contracts that explain the changes being made to their work.
Guaranteed freedoms
Governments provide requirements, entitlements and guidance that help define acceptable working conditions and
labor well-being. Data workers can face resistance when they attempt to raise organizational issues or collectivise.
Workers should not face impediments, intimidation or retaliation for availing any redressal or rights available to them.
Wherever possible, companies should follow local regulations and respect workers’ rights.
01
Non-interference in rights and regulations
Workers' contracts should not ask or require workers to waive any of their labor rights, contract terms, or any other
provisions and remedies available to them under local laws and regulations.
02
Freedom to raise issues
Companies should not, through contracts, business confidentiality measures, or any other means, stop and silence
workers from raising issues and sharing information on any challenges or risks they face in their work.
For example, workers cannot be prevented from discussing their distress or problems freely with their families,
doctors, lawyers, or mental health practitioners. 03
No penalisation for raising issues
No worker should be penalized, removed from work, or refused a contract renewal for raising issues with the
company, management, or among one's fellow workers.
04
No retaliation for seeking recourse from outside the firm
No workers should be removed from work, refused a contract renewal, stopped, intimidated, coerced, prohibited, or
penalized for pursuing legal remedies of any form, for associating with any worker-related collectivization or groups,
or for attempting to initiate or engaging in collectivizing or unionizing activities.
Trustworthy payroll
In the gig-based roles like data work, the way earnings are calculated, managed, and delivered is critical to labor
well-being. Issues like delays in payments, unpredictable availability of paid work, and low rates of remuneration
make earning through data work a challenge. Companies need to ensure that data workers can earn substantially
and on time, and that the systems governing pay are fair, predictable and transparent to workers.
01
Living and minimum wages
Companies should make arrangements to ensure that workers' take-home earnings exceed the minimum wage
stipulated by local laws and regulations. In the regions where living wage figures are available, companies have to
abide by living wages instead of minimum wages.
02
Payments for work-related labor beyond client tasks
Companies should remunerate the workers for the labor they complete in addition to their handling of data tasks. For
example, a considerable amount of unpaid labor gets done in completing tests and eligibility related tasks.
03
Payments in local national currency
By default, workers' remuneration should be paid in official national currency. Companies cannot force workers to
receive their earnings in alternative forms, such as cryptocurrency, gift cards, or digital currency.
This standard applies to any and all forms of money that is due to workers, including, but not limited to, salaries,
per-task pay, overtime pay, and bonuses and incentives.
04
Fixed schedule of payments
Regardless of whether they earn on a salary or per-task basis, all workers are to receive their pay as per the
schedule set by the organization. Changes to the schedule should be made after notifying all workers about the
impending change.
Auxiliary standards:
Workers who earn on a per-task basis or on platforms should receive their accrued earnings periodically,
based on a fixed schedule. For example, data workers’ earnings should be transferred to them at least once
a week without fail.
Workers earning on a per-task basis or on platforms should be able to request the transfer of their accrued
earnings before the scheduled payday. This provision should be available for use, at the very least, twice a
month.
05 Unconditional transfer of wages
Under no circumstances can a company delay or refuse to transfer a worker’s pay for completed work. Sending
people their earnings cannot be made conditional on things like surpassing metrics or adopting behaviours as
dictated by company management.
This standard applies to any and all payments due to data workers, be it “base pay” or “bonus pay.”
06
Access to payment records
All workers should be provided with accurate, up-to-date, downloadable, and printable records that describe the work
they have completed, the earnings due to them, and the status of past and pending payments. Workers receiving
electronic records only should also have an option to opt-in for receiving printed records.
A tentative and non-exhaustive list of information that the design of payment records can consider including is
provided below.
The data worker’s identification, featuring information like their full name, their designation, and
company-issued ID numbers.
The bill’s date of issue, the company’s method of payment.
The number and type of tasks completed, the project being serviced, and the worker’s supervisor.
The per-task rate, and the earnings due.
Any deductions made from dues on the grounds of tax requirements, worker penalties, or company charges.
Auxiliary standard: Companies should design workers' receipt documents in ways that make them usable with the
local tax authorities. The breakdown between any taxes deducted (including the rate of taxes), any commission
collected by the company or third parties, and the amount left for the data worker should be clearly depicted.
07
Share information about calculations
Companies should make the task pay calculation formulae, metrics, and processes transparent to the workers.
Changes to such systems should be indicated in the information provided to workers.
08
Payment monitoring and grievance redressal systems
Companies need dedicated personnel and resources to monitor remuneration processes and ensure timely and
correct payments. Workers should be provided with a dependable way to reach these assistance services for help
and to make inquiries.
Supportive workflows
Issues like inadequate specifications from clients, and insufficient training for completing tasks can make data
workers’ operations harder. Companies need to provide data workers with relevant capacity-building, sufficient
information on what they need to do, and reliable communication channels for support. Furthermore, workers should
be able to expect a reasonable level of transparency on the purpose of their work and the clients they service, and
their choices to accept or reject tasks should be respected.
01
Human involvement in communications
Companies should establish human-run communication channels where workers can directly interact with company
management to raise concerns and seek solutions. Workers should be notified of the availability of such
communication channels repeatedly, and they should be consulted to identify the format of communication most appropriate for them. This standard does not necessarily require workers and company personnel to be physically
present in the same space.
02
Language choice in communications
All communications directed at a worker should, at the very least, be provided in their native language, or one that
they have indicated. Companies should take the necessary steps to accommodate workers who have disabilities or
difficulties.
This standard applies to the companies data workers work for, the clients they treat data for, and any supervisors,
managers, or data-quality personnel overseeing workers.
03
Training for workers
Companies should provide adequate training to ensure workers have the required knowledge and skills to complete
tasks efficiently. This training should be comprehensive enough to include information on topics like how the tasks
need to be done, what kind of guidelines should be followed, and how to operate the tools (software and so on)
involved in completing the work.
04
Dedicated and responsive support with tools, software, and platforms
Companies need to have a dedicated team for resolving issues and doubts data workers face with the digital tools
and software needed to fulfill various aspects of their roles, such as team communications, treating and enriching
data, submitting work, or anything else.
Auxiliary Standards: For any hardware or software tools companies require workers to install on their device,
companies need to disclose to workers the functioning and usage of these tools, including any recording or tracking
functions.
05
Preparing instructions for workers
Companies should work with the clients to develop clear instruction sets for workers' use. This involves companies
directly working with clients to draft instructions and consulting workers to ensure such information's adequacy.
06
Clarity on clients and datasets’ purpose(s)
Workers should be provided enough information for them to be able to know what kind of work they are involved in,
and for them to make informed decisions about their engagement with the role. To this end, companies should at
least share information with workers about the purpose of the data work they do, who the client is, and what the data
might be used for.
Auxiliary standard: Whenever a worker is assigned to a new project or client, they should be briefed on the nature of
the data and content they will handle, and any harms they could be exposed to in the process.
07
Setting reasonable quotas and targets, and allowing breaks
Companies’ project management and distribution of tasks must not put workers at risk of adverse effects like mental
health problems, health distress, and burnout.
The quotas for completing tasks need to be set such that workers should be able to meet their targets while being
able to take breaks that allow a sufficient amount of mental and physical recovery. Companies should develop
role-specific targets after consulting data workers involved in different kinds of tasks. Further guidance on setting quotas and targets can be found in Standard 3 in “Lasting Collaboration"" under Stage 03.
08
Reasonable time periods for task completion
Companies should provide workers with an adequate time frame within which they need to complete the tasks
assigned to them before management diverts the tasks elsewhere. Companies should build systems that alert
workers about deadlines and impending redirection of tasks.
09
Regularizing working hours
Companies should follow national regulation on working hours, and in the absence of such regulations, have working
days that are no longer than 6 hours.
BPO
Auxiliary standards for all models involving the handling of disturbing content: All workers who handle data that
contains disturbing content, should be given periodic breaks to recover from the potential toll of the work. Taking
these breaks should not affect the workers’ performance evaluation or pay calculation in any way.
Companies should also conduct some form of check-ins that ask workers about their well-being, and offer options for
support, breaks from the work, and, if available, long-term or temporary transfers to other projects or work
assignments.
Auxiliary standard : All workers that work on a purely task basis, without fixed hours or fixed shifts, can stop and
resume working as they see fit. Businesses cannot penalize workers for being flexible with their working hours and
engagement with the platform.
DLP
10
Explanations for rejected tasks
All workers should receive communication on why their submitted task was rejected or flagged as ""incorrect.""
Furthermore, they should be provided assistance and guidance on meeting clients’ and validators’ requirements.
11
Opportunity to correct rejected tasks and earn
Workers who earn on a per-task basis should receive a chance to retry rejected tasks at least once. Companies
should pay full amount to the workers on correctly completing the task in the second attempt.
12
Abstaining from tasks and projects
Workers can refuse to work on a particular project or for a client on the grounds of the content of the data they will
handle. Companies should not penalize workers for such decisions.
Critical protections
Workers need assurances and protections that allow them to derive a decent living from their work. It is possible for
data workers to run into adverse circumstances, like contracting a serious illness, or to suffer work-related injuries or
trauma. Such events can have severe impacts, such as diminishing people’s savings or hindering their ability to work
and earn. Unpredictability in the availability of paid work can disrupt earnings and their ability to care for themselves
and their household. Thus, companies need to arrange measures that act as safety nets, worker care for hazardous
work, and as guarantees on earnings.
01
Identify workers’ risks and harms
Companies need to assess the kinds of risks and harms data workers shoulder. Such assessments should be driven
by extensive interactions with workers across the different data work roles across the company. This information should feed the development of policies and care measures (discussed in Standard 2 and 3 in “Comprehensive Care”
under Stage 02) that provide assistance and support to workers in forms like hazard pay, insurance policies, and
access to wellness services like counselling.
Companies that lack policies and measures of worker care must, at the very least, observe strict redlines that prohibit
the organization’s involvement in projects requiring data workers to handle disturbing content.
Further guidance on care measures for data workers can be found in Standards 2, 3, and 4 in “Comprehensive Care”
under Stage 02.
02
Providing care measures for at-risk workers
Companies must provide data workers immediate and unconditional access to care measures should their role
involve disturbing content. These measures must be adequately equipped to aid workers, and responsive to risks and
distress.
Auxiliary standard: Data workers needing mental health care should be able to opt for external services rather than
have to engage with company-affiliated practitioners and programmes. There should be no restrictions on data
workers’ ability to discuss things with the mental health service provider.
Further guidance on care measures for data workers can be found in Standard 3 in “Comprehensive Care” under
Stage 02.
03
Workers’ choice to work longer hours
No worker can be forcibly signed on to work for more than 8 hours a day, including breaks without overtime pay. A
worker can refuse overtime, and should not be penalized for their decision.
BPO
This standard’s recommendation of 8 hours as the maximum length of the working day is tentative. Companies
should engage workers, unions, and relevant labor institutions to understand good practices, and set their policies
accordingly.
04
Periodic breaks for active workers
All workers that work on a shift basis, or are monitored on metrics like time spent working, should be entitled to 1 hour
long lunch break and 15 minutes of break for every 2 hours of work.
This standard’s recommendation of providing breaktime relative to the hours of work done is tentative. Companies
should engage workers, unions, and relevant labor institutions to understand good practices, and set their policies
accordingly.
BPO
This standard’s recommendation of providing breaktime relative to the hours of work done is tentative. Companies
should engage workers, unions, and relevant labor institutions to understand good practices, and set their policies
accordingly.
05
Workers’ leaves
All workers that work on a shift basis, or are monitored as they work, are entitled to paid time off, and to sick leaves,
commensurate with the local regulations.
BPO 06
Minimum earning opportunities for workers
In situations where workers do not earn fixed salaries, and/or they are required to meet periodic company-mandated
quotas, they should have a minimum workload available to them every week. This minimum workload represents the
minimum amount of earnings accessible to workers, and is, at the very least, equivalent to 1 week's worth of the local
minimum wage. If living wage rates exist for the area, then they must be applied instead of minimum wage numbers.
Auxiliary standard: Companies should introduce and maintain channels that provide workers with information about
projects and opportunities within the organization. The onus to locate and apply for earnings opportunities should not
be solely on workers.
07
Ensuring substantial periods of work
Companies need to ensure that they assign people work on as constant a basis as possible.
For example, workers should not be benched for weeks or months at a time, only to receive a tiny amount of work for
a few days, before they are left without paid work again.
08
Limiting unpaid time for workers and offering basic support
Workers should not be benched for more than three weeks at a time. Should benching exceed 21 days, then workers
should get paid the minimum workload amount's worth to them for every additional week they spend benched.
This standard’s recommendation of 21 days as the maximum unpaid benching time is tentative. Companies should
engage workers, unions, and relevant labor institutions to understand good practices, and set their policies
accordingly.
09
Advance warning of unpaid waiting periods
Companies should strive to notify workers no less than 14 days in advance of getting benched. This notice should
also indicate the estimated duration for the benching. Companies must inform workers whenever they are about to
have their benching extended.
This standard’s recommendation of 14 days as the minimum notice period for unpaid benching time is tentative.
Companies should engage workers, unions, and relevant labor institutions to understand good practices, and set their
policies accordingly.
10
Minimizing workers’ involvement in production costs
Companies should not require workers to absorb the material costs of accessing data work and completing tasks.
Companies should take ownership of workers' operating costs and work-related expenses in one of two possible
ways.
First, companies develop a reimbursement or financial assistance system based on discussions with workers and
observing the expenditure they incur to complete tasks.
For example, through discussions with workers, companies could pilot an internet access allowance, providing active
workers with a money transfer sufficient to pay for a net pack for downloading and submitting work.
Second, companies interact with workers to identify key points of operational spending for them, and then find some
way to provide these services or assets to workers. For example, workers who complete data work using their personal SIMs may be losing substantial amounts of their
income to purchasing data packs. Companies can equip ground-level staff with internet hotspot devices that they can
visit workers with, reducing the operational burden on workers.
Some areas of coverage to consider on include, but are not limited to the following:
Damages and subsequent repairs for work-related equipment like phones and computers.
Internet connectivity packages needed to fulfill work requirements.
Travel services for the workers who must travel to a designated company workplace and cover long
distances.
Travel services for night shift workers.
Procurement of assistive devices like microphones and headphones for workers handling audio and speech
data related tasks.
Contestable termination
Opaque termination causes data workers to lose their source of income without a chance to adjust to clients and
companies’ needs, to defend themselves, or to appeal such decisions. Termination has been discussed as a format
for intimidation and retaliation against workers attempting to raise issues or take action. Termination practices need to
be transparent, justifiable,and should allow appeals and redressal for workers. Companies also need to ensure that
exiting workers are paid and their exit entitlements are fulfilled.
01
Termination policy governing removal of workers
Companies should provide a termination policy to workers that outlines the possible grounds for termination and the
notice period. No worker can be removed from the company for reasons outside the termination policy's contents.
02
Informing workers of impending termination
All workers should be given written notice about reasons and decisions related to their termination or non-renewal of
contracts in advance. This advance period should, at the very least, exceed 14 days. In addition to writing, such
notices should be communicated in additional formats that help the worker be informed about decisions regarding
their continued engagement with the company.
This standard’s recommendation of 14 days as the minimum notice period for termination is tentative. Companies
should engage workers, unions, and relevant labor institutions to understand good practices, and set their policies
accordingly.
03
Discussing termination and non-renewal with workers
Every worker should be able to have an interaction about decisions and reasons regarding possible termination or
non-renewal of contracts with human members of management. Such interactions can be in-person, or via some
technological means that is amenable to the worker.
04
Clearing payment dues with workers
Workers who have been asked to leave should be promptly paid any outstanding dues, including any form of
incentives or bonuses, for the work they have done till that point. Non-payment should carry some form of penalty,
such as companies having to pay 5% interest on the amount due for every day overdue. Workers should receive
updates and clear records of these processes.
This standard’s recommendation of 5% as the penalty for delays and non-payment of exiting workers’ dues is
tentative. Companies should engage workers, unions, and relevant labor institutions to understand good practices,
and set their policies accordingly. Auxiliary Standards: Companies with exit-related measures, such as severance or gratuity or any other
contribution-based measures, must ensure that such dues are also paid in a timely manner.
05
Human-mediation in termination processes
No workers can be terminated, or be rejected from contract renewal, at the sole discretion of algorithmic, automated
systems. A human being should oversee all decisions pertaining to workers' termination and/or non-renewal of their
contracts, and appeals processes.
06
Appeals process for termination decisions
All workers who are facing termination or non-renewal are entitled to an appeals process. Such appeals should
involve the worker meeting company personnel who make termination and non-renewal decisions. Workers are
entitled to having assistive figures present, like labor representatives, legal counsel, and any other form of aid local
laws and regulations allow.
Stage 02
The standards in the second stage focus on co-creating workflow design and worker-facing systems with the data
workers. Companies need to integrate measures into their business models and workflows to ensure worker safety,
provide social security, offer fair wages that reflect actual effort, support upskilling and grant credentials. Together, the
first two stages aim to manage precarities and develop fair processes across the data work companies’ workflows
and governance structures.
Comprehensive care
Data workers can engage in tasks and workflows that can harm them, such as in content moderation or the handling
of disturbing images for AI training. Over time, companies need to design, introduce, and manage “care measures”
that meaningfully help adversely affected workers, and provide compensation that reflects the risks and harms
workers bear.
01
Hazard pay for dangerous forms of work
Companies need to have a ""hazard pay"" system in place for work that can harm the workers handling the
data/content. At the very least, hazard pay rates should comply with local laws and regulations.
Auxiliary standard: Hazard pay should be arranged based on consultations with workers, worker representatives and
collective organizations like unions that represent data workers. The Hazard pay rate should be revised periodically
(such as when new kinds of tasks are introduced within the company's workforce), and the recalculation process
needs to be participatory and transparent to workers.
02
Connecting workers to health and safety measures
Data workers must be provided protections and assistance that assist them through forms of distress like sickness,
the inability to work, or potential adverse effects of work. Companies can utilize existing protections and institutions,
but must ensure that workers have aid and support that matches the level of risk and harm their roles entail.
Enrollment in existing measures: Should there be government-driven systems of support in place, for things
like insurance and healthcare, companies can direct workers towards these services. If data workers require
assistance or face access barriers, then companies should assist them with joining and using these
programmes. Introducing relevant measures: In cases where government-run programmes are absent in the area, or not
extended to data workers, companies are responsible for providing such services. These services need to
deliver adequate levels of aid that are easy and quick to avail.
Auxiliary standard: Companies need to be permissive in giving data workers time to seek treatment and assistance.
Workers should not be penalized, have their pay reduced, or have their performance evaluations downrated, for time
spent in seeking aid. If they have depleted the sick leaves they are entitled to, workers should regardless be given
penalty-free opportunities to use care measures.
03
Defining and upholding a duty of care policy
Companies need to have a “duty of care policy” (DoC) guaranteeing support and assistance that is aligned to risks
and problems identified by data workers. As discussed in Standard 2 and 3 in “Critical Protections” under Stage 01,
companies that have not developed and implemented a DoC policy and care mechanisms must adopt and adhere to
institutional redlines. These redlines must prohibit companies from accepting projects that put workers in roles
featuring disturbing content.
Auxiliary standard: Information on a company’s duty of care policy must be easily available for workers’ perusal.
Informing workers should not be restricted to mailing them policies, but need to consider methods like having people
on the ground who can answer questions, and conducting orientations on DoC policies and changes.
04
Accountable management of care mechanisms
Enrollment and membership processes for company-run care mechanisms need to prioritize workers’ ability to
access and use services. Ideally, care mechanisms need to be universally provided. Should companies use some
form of eligibility criteria, they should be clearly communicated to the workers and the companies should strive to
make these requirements reasonable and contestable.
Contestability: Workers should be able to check and contest any data that is collected for eligibility purposes.
For example, if attendance tracking is used to decide insurance eligibility, then workers should be able to
check these records, and access grievance redressal if they have problems in the attendance logged.
Reasonableness: For workers not handling disturbing materials, eligibility conditions for care mechanisms
should be minimalistic and, as far as possible, have short “qualifying periods” for being able to use services.
As mentioned in Standard 3 in “Critical Protections” under Stage 02, data workers with hazardous roles must
have access to care mechanisms upon starting such projects.
For example, workers should not have to wait six months to be eligible for protections like insurance.
Something like having completed a thirty-day period of completing tasks should be enough to qualify them
for company-run care mechanisms.
Auxiliary standard: When government-run services lack the provisions necessary to provide care that aligns with the
risks and harms of the work, companies should make appropriate arrangements. These arrangements should be
substantial enough to cover the cost of seeking the treatments or assistance for the harms their roles can cause.
For example, if a data worker’s treatment, recovery, or prevention involves medication as well as therapy, the
company-provided care mechanisms need to cover the entire cost involved.
Co-designed operations There can be a disconnect between how policies are designed by companies and the conditions data workers
experience on the ground. There are tasks that require repeated attempts and considerable effort to satisfy data
requirements, but pay out small sums. Discussions between labor and workers on matters like performance
evaluation, or how task rates consider workers’ time and effort, can help build fairer processes for reviewing and
compensating data workers.
01
Collaborate with workers to develop task rates
Companies should work with the workers to understand and consider the ground realities which plays a role in
determining the actual time and effort that goes into fulfilling the tasks. Based on this data, companies should work
with the workers to set the task rates.
This standard is further expanded upon in Standard 2 in “Lasting Collaboration” under Stage 3.
02
Worker consultation for performance metrics
In arrangements where workers are required to fulfill metrics set by the management, periodic consultations between
companies and its workers must be held. In these consultations, workers can raise issues on any adverse effects and
strain caused by existing metrics , and can recommend alteration in order to maintain workers' health and ability to
work.
Visible workers
Data workers commit substantial amounts of effort to learn different tools and meet eligibility requirements for various
task formats. Data workers lack ways to record and present their work experience and skill development, something
which is crucial for career progression and seeking new earning opportunities. Companies need to recognise data
workers as assets and contributors, and provide opportunities and testimonials to them. Initiatives like providing
work-experience records and skilling programs can help data workers manage their careers and navigate uncertain
job markets.
01
Furnish workers with credentials
Companies need to implement a system for providing workers with formal records and certification, which they can
use to apply elsewhere and build a body of work experience.
For example, companies can develop “skill passports” that leave data workers with attested records of their
experience and competencies.
Auxiliary Standard: Companies should work to provide records that can be recognized by businesses within and
beyond the data work sector. Workers need to have sufficient proof of their engagement with data work companies,
some way to carry forward data regarding their reputation and performance, and reasonably descriptive accounts of
their work experience and proficiencies.
02
Enable upskilling among workers
Companies need to arrange or build skilling programs that help workers to either transition to better-paying data work
roles, or to pursue opportunities in other professions and organizations.
03
Transparency in worker evaluation
Companies need to administer data workers’ pay increases, promotions, and evaluations in a transparent manner.
Companies need to provide workers with clear, up-to-date and accurate information on how career progression and individual evaluation works within the organization, covering topics like promotions, pay adjustment, feedback,
penalties, and applying for new roles.
BPO
Stage 03
The level of policy engagement with data work and its problems is unevenly distributed across the world. Companies
can look to international guidance on topics like labour welfare, responsible business practices, and human rights to
think about how to build better workplaces. Beyond looking outwards for guidance, companies should engage with
external initiatives to assess conditions and practice, discuss labor issues, and design improvements.
Receptive governance
The level of policy engagement with data work and its problems is unevenly distributed across the world. Companies
can look to international guidance on topics like labour welfare, responsible business practices, and human rights to
think about how to build better workplaces. Beyond looking outwards for guidance, companies should engage with
external initiatives to assess conditions and practice, discuss labor issues, and design improvements.
01
Integrate rights frameworks and charters into company governance
Companies need to adopt frameworks and take steps to uphold human rights in the workplaces they manage. They
should conduct human rights impact assessments and release publicly available reports.
02
Openness to third-party inspections
In addition to publishing publicly accessible reports discussing their labour practices, companies should develop the
practice of hosting external assessments of working conditions and socioeconomic trends of data work. It should be
possible for external parties representing labour, civil society, or the state, to attempt research and assessments
focusing on data workers without interference or hindrance from businesses.
Auxiliary standard: When companies open their doors to external parties for reasons like research or assessment,
they need to enable the visiting party to choose how they conduct their work and interact with people. Companies
need to refrain from attempting to control or influence the information or testimonies external parties can access.
Lasting collaboration
A growing number of voices are talking about the risks and problems data workers face. Data work has been
associated with issues like low pay, unpaid labor, uncertainty in getting paid work, precariously short contracts,
intense work pressure, and adverse effects on health and mental well-being. Directly engaging workers and unions is
key to understanding problems within and beyond the workflow. Such engagement can help address labor conditions
in ways that are useful to workers and improve the workflows driving the business.
01
Work with labor stakeholders
Formally acknowledge collective organizations and engage in negotiation efforts with them. Companies need to be
ready to form and implement agreements with stakeholders like unions. Workers must be safe from company-side
penalties or retaliation for participating in or initiating collective action.
02
Co-design a pay system for remunerating effort, not tasks
Companies should co-develop a process with the workers for remunerating the basic effort involved in tasks, with
tasks’ “correctness” no longer being the defining criteria. Through this protocol, the workers must be given a chance to negotiate the wages as per the amount of effort needed and skills committed in completing the tasks in question.
This standard applies to the entirety of the compensation possible for a worker, including, but not limited to, base pay,
bonus and incentive pay, and hazard pay. Companies need to conduct this co-development process with workers at
least once a year.
They should also open up discussions whenever they introduce new kinds of tasks and roles to the workforce.
For example, if a data work company starts taking content moderation contracts, they should initiate discussions on
how earnings will be calculated, regardless of whether one such meeting has already been held that year.
03
Sustainable work targets
Companies need to have a well-defined process for how they set the “quotas” or “targets” workers need to meet
within a particular time period (in an hour, in a day, by the end of the week, and so on). Workers and businesses need
to work together to set targets such that workers are not at risk of suffering from adverse effects like burnout,
worsening worse stress, and health conditions.
Co-designed targets can be seen as the “optimal workload” that lies between ensuring that everyone can earn
substantial amounts of pay, and that company quotas are not causing worker distress or putting their well-being at
risk.
04
Transitions into full employment
For long-serving workers, companies need to create and provide the option for them to transition from a contractor
position to full employment. Workers should also be able to seek letters of service from the company that attest to
their work experience and possibly offer commendation.
05
Routinely consult workers about changes and issues
Establish consultation mechanisms where companies discuss key issues, like pay, and co-design solutions and
changes. Workers must not be penalized, disciplined, or called out for attempting to raise issues, discussing changes,
and calling for action.

standards for data work. Please get in touch with us with any questions or ideas you have!
I. Glossary
Data workers
Working people who handle data materials as per the specifications of their companies and paying clients, for
purposes like the training of artificial intelligence (AI) or the moderation of user-generated content in online spaces.
Data workers fulfill numerous roles, ranging from labelling images to responding to tickets regarding disturbing
content on social media to helping evaluate large language models (LLMs). Data work can be conducted through
different business models, like business process outsourcing (BPO) and digital labour platforms (DLPs). It is
important to note that data work is not a fixed category of roles. It refers to a wide variety of roles, with the possibility
of new roles emerging that exhibit the characteristics of data work. Workflow
The processes, policies, infrastructure, and people that manage the working environment in which data workers
operate.
Disturbing Materials and Content/ Riskier Work
Tasks and data that feature content that can cause physical and mental health harms, or put people at risk of adverse
effects, either through short-term or sustained exposure. Some examples of disturbing materials include hate speech,
footage and imagery of graphic violence, content featuring sexual abuse, and online posts displaying the abuse of
children.
At-Risk Workers
The workers who routinely handle disturbing materials, be it for content moderation roles or otherwise, are classified
as at-risk workers. This term is not being used with intent to reduce the experiences of other categories of data
workers, but to highlight that some people have to face not only precarious work engagements but also handle large
volumes of content that people should not have to endure under any circumstances.
Care Mechanism
The various services and measures companies design, adopt, and manage to provide aid and support to data
workers. Care mechanisms can range from providing insurance to reducing or covering operating costs involved in
data work.
II. Core Values
Based on our research and understanding of the precarities faced by data workers in the ecosystem, we developed a
set of values that act as the fundamental criteria for creating a safe working environment and promoting workers’
well-being. These values form the core basis on which the standards are formulated. Standards are different
pathways to make these values actionable. Hence, every standard is associated with one or more of these core
values.
Freedom
Workers should be able to exercise their rights and seek external recourse, remedy, and counsel without interference,
coercion, or intimidation from workplaces. Restrictions on workers’ discussing their work and experiences with
external parties should be applied only when it is absolutely necessary for the sake of the client or sensitivities
surrounding the data.
Recognition
The companies running workplaces should have a full grasp of the realities of data work and the production
processes. Businesses must be cognizant of the time, effort, skill, risks, and even danger that data work can require,
and provide their workforces with adequate levels of compensation, support, and aid.
Transparency Data work relationships need to be transparent in ways that empower and equip workers with key information about
their roles, their engagement with companies, and the production processes they enable. Businesses need to work to
provide workers with a variety of information, ranging from clear explanations of their relationship with the companies
and how they are managed to how wages are calculated and how worker performance is measured, recognized, and
penalized.
Stability
Data work roles should be designed and managed in ways that provide a meaningful level of stability to people
fulfilling companies data requirements. Stability itself would arise from companies achieving adequacy in critical
labour areas, such as compensation, managing the time workers spend “benched,” social security and hazard-related
measures, and worker assistance.
Support
Workplaces need to offer data workers tools, processes, and assistance that help them fulfill their roles safely and
with minimal barriers. Companies need to build and maintain measures that protect workers’ safety, address
emerging safety issues and hazards, and ensure that workers have the means and information necessary to
complete work and earn.
Collaboration
The process of arranging projects and delivering AI-related services should be governed such that there is plenty of
space for discussions and co-designing the workflow. Companies should engage workers as more than a source of
feedback, and work with labour stakeholders to shape production pipelines and workers’ arrangements. Furthermore,
companies themselves should move to open themselves to external initiatives geared towards impact assessments
and understanding working conditions.
III. Model cognizance in developing standards
The data enrichment industry consists of a range of business models. Data work’s challenges as well as the
pathways for pursuing ethical treatment of labor, can differ based on companies' business models. There are a
number of “model-specific standards” that are meant for following two broad type of business models:
Business Process Outsourcing/ BPO: Set-ups where workers produce data under company supervision,
possibly in a designated location rather than an online environment. BPO models may run offices outfitted
with various assets and infrastructures that allow workers to function in their roles. One prominent example
of the BPO model is the French firm, Teleperformance.
Digital Labor Platforms/ DLP: Arrangements that utilize the internet and various software to link different
players and processes of data production together, allowing people otherwise separated to collaborate and
exchange money, goods, and services. DLP models treat workers as independent entities who may need to
arrange things like computers, phones, and internet needed for work through their own resourcefulness and
funds. Amazon Mechanical Turk and Remotasks are examples of DLPs offering data work solutions.
These model-specific standards are marked by a tag that reads as “BPO” for Business Process Outsourcing, and
“DLP” for Digital Labor Platforms.",6842

03
On a sunny afternoon in Nairobi, Kenya, a data worker receives
footage from a Roomba vacuum. The worker labels the objects
that the Roomba encounters, such as table legs and floor lamps,
in order to teach it to avoid obstacles, and identifies a carpet
so that the vacuum learns when it should apply greater suction.
Another data worker is given a one-minute pornographic video.
The worker types a list of 40 hashtags that describe the video
based on the characteristics of the actors–the color of their hair
or skin, the size and features of their bodies–so that the video
can be categorized for search results. A third data worker is
provided images of a murder victim at a crime scene. The worker
zooms into an image to trace the outline of a bullet wound and
a smashed skull, and labels them as such, to train AI to perform
post-mortem analyses. A final worker monitors reels on TikTok,
flagging user-generated content for infractions of the platform’s
terms, such as violent threats or graphic footage.
The seamless functionality of artificial intelligence and the
relative safety of online spaces are made possible by a vast,
often hidden, global workforce. Data labelers and content
moderators form the essential human infrastructure for the
world’s largest technology firms, performing critical tasks that
machines have not mastered. Labelers meticulously annotate
images, text, and videos–training the algorithms that power
everything from facial recognition and self-driving cars to
chatbots and recommendation engines. Content moderators
serve as the frontline guardians of online platforms–”digital
first responders”–reviewing vast quantities of user-generated
content to identify and remove harmful material, including hate
speech, misinformation, and graphic imagery. These workers
are fundamental to building trustworthy AI and maintaining
the integrity of the virtual world, yet their contributions are
undervalued and obscured from public view. Introduction
04
This report focuses on data workers in a growing technology
hub: Nairobi, Kenya. Fueled by a young, educated, tech-savvy
population, a workforce with cultural and linguistic proficiency,
an economy with globally competitive labor costs, and
significant government efforts to lure tech-related investment,
Kenya has emerged as a center for digital labor. Thousands
of Kenyans are employed by business process outsourcing
companies (BPOs) or work for online labor platforms,
undertaking data annotation and content moderation on behalf
of major global corporations. A defining characteristic of the
digital economy, in Kenya and elsewhere, is the complex web of
outsourcing relationships. Major tech companies rarely employ
labelers or moderators directly. Instead, they contract the work
to large multinational BPOs or specialized platforms that, in
turn, often subcontract parts of the work to smaller, local BPOs
or use labor brokers to enlist workers from local labor markets.
The layers of subcontracting in digital supply chains create
opacity: workers at the end of the chain have no visibility into
the end client whose products they are building or safeguarding.
Outsourcing has profound impacts on working conditions, as
layers of intermediaries skim margins and make it difficult for
workers to hold lead firms accountable for labor violations or
poor treatment. This report sheds light on the experiences of
Kenyan data workers at the far reaches of digital supply chains
and offers recommendations based on workers’ desires for
improved working conditions. Methodology and Sample
05
During July 2025, the Data Labellers Association administered
an in-person survey to digital supply chain workers in Kenya
to better understand their working conditions and the impacts
of this work on their wellbeing, yielding 226 valid surveys.
All survey responses are anonymous. The sample includes data
labellers (87%), content moderators (8%), and other digital
workers such as transcribers (5%). Of these respondents,
54% worked for online platforms and 46% were employed by
BPOs. Among the respondents who worked for BPOs, 19 firms
were represented.
In terms of educational attainment, 39% of respondents have
earned a bachelor’s degree, 39% have completed some university
studies, 22% have a high school diploma, and 1% have a master’s
degree. The top areas of study were computer science (22%),
engineering (11%), and business administration (10%).
More than one-quarter (28%) of respondents are age 20 to 25,
more than half (54%) are 26 to 31 years old, 17% are 32 to 37 years
old, and 2% are 38 years old or older (Figure 1).

Fifty-eight percent of respondents were men and 42%

All respondents were born in Kenya. Outsourced Work in Digital Supply Chains
06
Leading global corporations, including technology firms, major
retailers, and online platforms, outsource essential data tasks
like content moderation and AI training to BPOs and digital
labor platforms. These BPOs and platforms manage global
workforces of data workers who perform tasks according to the
end clients’ specifications, while workers have little insight into
who their work benefits and how it will be used.
While most data workers opt to work for either a BPO or a
platform, 23% of workers surveyed are working for both a BPO
and a platform, an indication of workers’ attempts to diversify
income sources and increase their take-home pay.
Workers hired by BPOs are likely to have an employment
contract with their employer (82%). Yet one quarter of those
workers say they do not understand everything in their
contract. Nearly all (93%) of BPO workers are asked to sign a
non-disclosure agreement as a condition of employment, which
can have consequences for speaking out about substandard
conditions or other workplace challenges.
Platform workers are far less likely than those employed by
BPOs to have a contract with the platform they use most
frequently (26%), and of those, two-thirds (67%) do not
understand everything in their contract. Contract documents
can be lengthy and use legal language unfamiliar to workers.
Thirty-four percent of platform workers report being asked to
sign a non-disclosure agreement.
Non-payment of work is a common issue: more than half
of platform workers (53%) report that, in the past year, they
have done platform work and not been paid for the tasks they
completed. Workers report tasks being rejected, often with no
explanation, account deactivation without notice or recourse,
and waiting long periods between task completion and payment.
Lack of payment and delayed payment can have substantial
impacts on workers’ financial insecurity, a topic we turn to next. Data Workers Face Mounting Financial Hardships
07
Despite playing a critical role in the digital economy, many data
workers face persistent financial hardships. With inadequate
job security and compensation well below a living wage, they
struggle to meet basic needs, including paying for housing,
healthcare, and education and childcare, even as their labor fuels
the development of cutting-edge technologies. This disconnect
between the value of their contributions and their economic
personal realities underscores the growing inequality in digital
supply-chain labor markets.

09
Data work poses significant physical and mental health risks
to workers. Many data annotators and content moderators
experience isolation, inadequate support from their employer,
and burnout. Physically, both roles involve prolonged
sedentary periods staring at screens, which can lead to eye
strain, headaches, repetitive injuries such as carpal tunnel
syndrome, and musculoskeletal disorders resulting from poor
ergonomics. While 54% of survey respondents report that
working as a data worker has had no impact on their physical
health, 36% report a negative impact, and just 9% report a
positive impact (Figure 8). By far, the leading negative impact
is degraded eyesight and eye strain as a result of prolonged
screen time, followed by back pain that comes from sitting for
extended periods.
Mentally, the impacts of

moderators who are regularly

or disturbing material. Data

annotators, depending on the

project, also face psychological

annotation tasks can lead to
fatigue and low morale due
to repetition and pressure to
intensify the pace of work.
The survey finds that 48% of
data annotators report that
working as a data worker has
had no impact on their mental
health, 27% report a negative
impact, and 25% report a
positive impact (Figure 9). Health Risks for Data Workers

Mental Health
estimates. The sample size of
content moderators is too
small to allow for separate
analysis, but we believe the
prevalence of negative mental
health impacts is considerably
higher among content
moderators.
Eighteen percent of data workers report having to repeatedly
view content that was violent or disturbing, and the vast
majority (80%) report that viewing disturbing content caused
them to experience negative feelings. Many workers keep
these feelings to themselves, lacking a person with whom they
feel comfortable sharing such difficult experiences. Workers
report that some employers (41%) offer what they call “wellness
coaches” to support workers, but many workers say they fear
that the information they share will be used against them.
Others lack confidence that talking with a wellness coach
would be helpful. Data Worker Demands
11
Data workers are essential to the functioning of today’s
digital economy, yet many continue to face low pay, insecure
employment, and health challenges related to their work.
In response, data workers are developing an employer code
of conduct that affirms workers’ right to fair treatment
and dignified labor. This includes improvements in pay that
reflect the value of their contributions, reasonable working
hours and predictable scheduling, transparent and secure
contracts, and access to essential benefits such as mental health
and medical care. These standards are not only a matter of
fairness—they are foundational to building a more ethical and
sustainable digital economy.
Survey respondents identified four key components of more
fair and equitable employment. The first concerns pay: the most
commonly cited desire is changes in pay standards, principally
the need to raise pay rates. As the survey data showing
widespread financial hardships makes clear, data workers in
Kenya routinely struggle to cover their basic living expenses.
Employment insecurity is a reality for many, if not most, data
workers in Kenya. Because of this, a second key demand is the
adoption of longer-tenure, legally binding contracts written
in language workers understand. Many data workers operate
as independent contractors or through layers of subcontracting,
which strips them of job security, benefits, and avenues
for recourse against substandard working conditions. This
precariousness contributes to a constant sense of instability
and pressure to accept any available work, regardless of its
impact on workers’ well-being. Data Worker Demands
12
Relatedly, respondents called for revisions to company
policies governing work hours. This includes calls to reduce
the required number of work hours, allowances for greater
working time flexibility, and the easing of deadlines that require
overly long workdays. Data annotators often face sporadic
work schedules, ambiguous task instructions, and constant
performance monitoring. Mistakes can lead to immediate
loss of income or access to future assignments. Data workers
are employed in high-pressure environments, often under
conditions that are physically, psychologically, and emotionally
taxing. Underlying the demand to alter scheduling practices is
the need to alleviate some of the work stresses that have been so
debilitating for the workforce.
In recognition of the physical and mental hardships faced by
data workers, a fourth demand concerns the need for companies
to provide better mental health counseling as well as medical
insurance. Data workers involved in content moderation
are frequently exposed to graphic and disturbing material—
such as violence, hate speech, and sexual abuse—at a rapid pace,
sometimes reviewing hundreds of items per day. This has led
to widespread reports of trauma, depression, and substance
abuse among workers, especially in outsourced operations.
Companies in the digital economy bear some responsibility for
the harmful exposures to which workers are subjected, and they
must do more to safeguard their well-being. Harms could be at
least partially mitigated by (a) contracts that provide greater
transparency about work tasks and ensure workers’ informed
consent to undertake these tasks, (b) a more robust support
infrastructure that helps workers cope with the emotional toll
of these tasks, and (c) more worker-friendly scheduling that
eases the burdens associated with intense periods of exposure
to harmful material.",2479
TikTok German workers strike demands,ver.di,https://uniglobalunion.org/news/tiktok-content-moderators-strike-ai-berlin/,Demands,Union (or federation),Content moderators,Germany,07-01-2025,verdi.pdf,"Workers at TikTok’s Berlin headquarters are on strike today, 23 July, to protest the
company’s refusal to negotiate conditions of an announced mass firing of 150 content
moderators. The layoffs come as part of the social media platform’s plan to shutter its
Trust and Safety Department and shift critical moderation work to AI and external
providers.
Workers, who have spent recent months training the AI systems now slated to replace
them, are rallying under the banner: “We trained your machines – pay us what we
deserve!”
German union ver.di, a UNI affiliate, called the strike with clear demands:
● Severance payments equal to three years’ salary per employee
● 12-month extension of the notice period
The employees say such support is crucial not only to recognize their skilled labour but
also to help them retrain and transition into new careers – particularly necessary for
workers whose residency status in Germany depends upon employment.
These steps are needed in recognition of the severe stress and trauma the job can
create, and considering TikTok generates over US$23 billion annually – partly thanks to
their labour – moderators argue their modest demands for fair severance and transition
support are fully justified.
“It is disrespectful of TikTok to shirk all social responsibility and even refuse to negotiate
with us. Today, the employees are sending a clear signal that they will not accept this.
They are going on strike and, in doing so, becoming pioneers of union organizing in the
platform economy,” says Lucas Krentel, Deputy Regional Head of the Media Division at
ver.di Berlin-Brandenburg.
ver.di warns that by outsourcing content moderation, TikTok evades responsibility for fair
pay, adequate psychological support and stable working conditions – further degrading
already demanding work. Moderators emphasize that AI cannot adequately handle
culturally sensitive decisions, and human oversight is essential to a safe platform.
“Content moderators are essential to making the internet safe and usable, but
companies like TikTok too often degrade their conditions and devalue the work of these
professionals. Today’s strike is an important moment where content moderators are
demanding recognition for all they’ve done – and sacrificed – to protect TikTok users. We stand with ver.di and with moderators everywhere who are organizing, speaking out
and fighting back,” said Benjamin Parton, Head of UNI’s ICTS sector.
On a global level, UNI has supported the first-ever trade union alliance of content
moderators to fight for living wages, safe working conditions and union representation
in their industry. Last month, the alliance launched a comprehensive health and safety
protocol for safer, sustainable content moderation.
UNI stands with ver.di and TikTok moderators in Berlin, whose fight is crucial to securing
dignity, fair compensation and humane working conditions for content moderators
everywhere in the digital age.

(Austin, Texas)—Today, Alphabet Workers Union-CWA members on the
Google Help team secured a first collective contract with Google vendor
Accenture, becoming the first group of AWU-CWA represented workers to
bargain a collective contract and only the second group of Google office
workers ever to do so.

“We're proud to be one of the few tech contractors in the US to secure a
collectively-bargained contract. Many large tech companies have moved away
from directly employing workers to avoid providing the benefits and security that
they deserve. We hope this contract demonstrates to all tech workers that it's
possible to demand respect, fair treatment, and improve your working
conditions,” said Mike Batilla, Lead Writer and member of Alphabet
Workers Union-CWA.
Reaching this contract sets a precedent for temporary, vendor, and contract
workers in the tech industry, who too often receive the lowest wages and
fewest protections of any tech workers, and whose numbers have been
growing as the industry increasingly “vendorizes” its workforce. Now some of
Alphabet’s most precarious workers have united to win meaningful
protection against the further depression of their working conditions and
security in an industry in flux.
Notable provisions of the contract include:
Guaranteed fully remote work
Six weeks of severance in the event of layoffs
30 day notice of layoffs
A prohibition on keystroke and mouse monitoring software
This group of subcontracted workers first organized to improve their working
conditions in 2021 and afterward unionized with Alphabet Workers Union-
CWA. On June 7, 2023, 118 Google Help workers voted overwhelmingly to
form a union, but shortly thereafter Google laid off all but 40 of them. The 26
workers in the unit today persevered in the face of adversity and have won
meaningful security for themselves and future coworkers. Accenture
engaged with them at the bargaining table in good faith, and today AWU-
CWA can announce a ratified contract that includes significant protections

and improvements including guaranteed remote work, severance, just cause
termination, and more.
“Today’s victory underscores the importance of solidarity across the artificial
barriers which corporations increasingly rely on to lower labor standards and
reduce worker power. This contract is proof that full time and contract workers
can unite to secure meaningful protections and improvements at work and that
the wall-to-wall, premajority union model can be a force for change in our
industry,” said Parul Koul, Software Engineer and President of Alphabet
Workers Union-CWA.
These workers write, edit and publish updates to the Google Support site for
new and existing Google products and features and create and publish
materials for Google Support agents.

Teleperformance are marking a year of accelerated progress in strengthening workers’
rights and improving the health and safety of employees, particularly content
moderators, across the company’s global operations.
The three-year pact, which was sealed on 1 December 2022, is the first of its kind in the
business services sector and covers nearly 500,000 Teleperformance employees in 95
countries. It is based on the recognition of core labour rights as established by the
International Labour Organization and respect for the OECD Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises.
UNI and Teleperformance have started implementation of the global agreement in
Colombia, El Salvador, Jamaica, Poland and Romania, representing over 50,000
workers.
The implementation agreements signed in these countries flesh out the terms of the
global pact, and in real terms, they confirm and secure workers the right to organize in
freedom and autonomy, while allowing unions access to Teleperformance workers both
on-site and remotely.
More countries, outside the initial five, are now in the process of negotiating their own
implementation agreements.
UNI and Teleperformance have used the global agreement’s provisions to form an
international working party on health and safety, which brings together management,
workers, experts and UNI trade union affiliates to look at health and safety risks.
Christy Hoffman, General Secretary of UNI Global Union, said:
“Teleperformance is leading the way in its industry for respecting human rights due
diligence. Together with the company and unions on the ground, we are making our
global agreement a reality by improving safety for workers, especially content
moderators. We look forward to deepening our relationships with management at all
levels of the corporation to further training and recognition for freedom of association
and collective bargaining.”
Olivier Rigaudy, Deputy CEO of Teleperformance, said: “Teleperformance is deeply committed to Corporate Social Responsibility and has been
a signatory of the UN Global Compact since 2011. In line with our values and CSR
practices, this agreement confirms our willingness to strengthen our commitments
regarding social dialogue. A constructive social dialogue has a key role to play in our
business development. Together with UNI, we can make Teleperformance an even
better place to work.”",365

Turkers demands to Mturk
admin August 18, 2022
We call on the leaders to:
1. Limit the number of rejections the platform will allow to affect a
worker’s approval rate when a requester rejects all work (i.e. 10
rejections per day would affect the approval rating, the others would, of
course, still be rejected, but only the first 10 would affect the worker’s
rating.)
2. Consult with the coalition of worker forums to problem-solve together
to create solutions and improve Mechanical Turk for everyone.
Amazon Mechanical Turk is used by thousands of workers daily; all taking
the chance of being mass rejected without protection. Turkopticon provides
a space for workers to report these conditions, but we need more. Workers
want to feel safe while working on the platform and have protection from
mass rejections. Workers believe in rejections because unfortunately, there
are bad workers, but good workers are getting unjustly hurt by them.
Limiting the number of rejections that can affect a worker’s approval rating
is something workers all agree will help everyone, including requesters.
Requesters, especially new unrated ones, will get their work completed
quicker because the fear of mass rejection will disappear.
Why is this important?
https://blog.turkopticon.net/?p=2623 Page 1 of 2 Turkers demands to Mturk - Turkopticon 10/3/25, 11:42 AM
Workers behind AI, even invisible, still matter. Our stories have been
neglected for years and it’s our time to feel safer while doing our work in an
unbalanced platform that only protects requester’s voices. A victory for us
is a victory for all workers.

TELUS must respect the right to organize and bargain collectively,UNI Global,https://uniglobalunion.org/news/telus-must-respect-the-right-to-organize-and-bargain-collectively/,Demands,Union (or federation),Content moderators,"Canada, Turkey",01-08-2025,uni_2.pdf,"Today, on 1 August 2025, in Izmir, Türkiye, an international delegation – comprised of
trade union representatives from Türkiye, Canada and multiple other countries, united
under UNI Global Union – calls for an urgent, global dialogue with TELUS, the major
Canadian multinational telecommunications and business services company. This
united front marks the first step in our collective push for a global agreement that
guarantees fundamental labour rights for all TELUS workers, no matter where they are.
TELUS’s growth has been powered by thousands of workers in customer service,
technicians and outsourced operations worldwide. This growth must be matched by a
strong commitment to labour rights, social justice and the dignity of the people who
make its business possible.
Therefore, the undersigned trade unions call on TELUS to:
1. Fully recognize the right to organize and to bargain collectively in every country
where the company operates, without interference, in accordance with the core
conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO). Telus will abide by
collective agreements in good faith. Telus will not engage in anti-union behaviour.
2. Establish effective and transparent procedures for resolving labour conflicts,
through genuine dialogue and in good faith, avoiding any form of retaliation or
repression against union activity.
3. Guarantee common minimum labour standards, including protection of physical
and mental health, psychologically reasonable work metrics, decent wages, fair
working conditions, job security and employment stability.
4. Protect union members from any form of discrimination or retaliation, ensuring
they are free to organize, represent and negotiate on behalf of their co-workers.
We also raise our serious concerns about the situation in Türkiye, where TELUS has so
far refused to recognize the trade union chosen by the workers. Union members and
leaders report facing harassment and unfair dismissals simply for exercising their right
to join a union. Such practices are unacceptable and contradict international labour
standards.
In Canada, TELUS has been downsizing and outsourcing its Canadian operations with
scant regard for the impact on workers or working conditions. But we believe these issues can be remedied through constructive engagement.
Through dialogue, we can develop binding commitments and ensure the same rights
and protections for workers across the company’s operations.",361

Event recap: Humans in the

workers
On February 6th, the NLP Community of Practice’s Ethics & Governance Working
Group convened to discuss the impact of AI development on the (human) workers
involved in developing and refining Large Language Models (LLMs). We also wanted to
highlight current thinking on what can be done to counteract the labour abuses
currently baked into AI supply chains, emphasising that negative impacts can also
occur at a smaller scale, for example when adapting LLMs in-house for ‘positive’
reasons such as improving relevance and safety. The recording and resources for this
event can be found here.

African teenagers, Big Sis.
Mophat Okinyi, Chairperson of the Content Moderator’s Union, founder and CEO
of Techworker Community Africa, and recently named one of TIME’s 100 most
influential people in AI 2024, who talked about his first-hand experiences of AI
labour, and shared his thoughts on how we can all support data workers.

Internet Institute, who have developed an assessment framework and
guidance for evaluating the labour conditions of data platforms, including
LLMs.
“The act of simplifying reality for a
machine results in a great deal of
complexity for the human.”
Our discussion kicked off with a brief overview of the role of humans in Large
Language Model development, a topic highlighted by this in-depth expose as early
as 2023 and which has now gained mainstream recognition. The ongoing role of
human input is encapsulated by a comment from a source that noted wryly that
“ChatGPT seems so human because it was trained by an AI that was mimicking
humans who were rating an AI that was mimicking humans who were pretending to be
a be$er version of an AI that was trained on human writing.”
Soma provided a useful metaphor: a parent teaching a child to talk by helping them
associate sights, sounds, smells or sensations with certain words is much like the
heart of the data annotation process. In AI terms, each time an association is made
https://merltech.org/resources/in-house-data-annotation-best-practice-principles-developed-by-mti/ Page 2 of 10 In-house data annotation best practice principles developed by MTI - MERL Tech 10/3/25, 12:33 PM
between, say, the image of a dog and the word/sound ‘dog’, a new ‘row’ of data is
created. But because, despite what we may feel, AI is not nearly as adept as humans
at learning independently, the data it is fed needs to be forma$ed in hyper-specific
ways. This is a second way in which data annotators perform an invisible function: “AI
has no methodology of exploring the world (…) so it’s not just pointing out that a
picture means ‘mum’ or ‘dad’, it’s pu$ing that association in a format that a computer
will understand.”
These two steps alone represent one of the many ‘layers’ of data annotation that
needs to take place to train an AI system. The additional stages are the equivalent of
moving beyond individual word associations during our toddler years to
understanding things like grammar and syntax as we develop. The role of data
annotators as parents and teachers of AI, can’t be overstated – and this is entirely at
odds with the poor working conditions many who do this work experience.
The reality of data annotation for
Global South Workers
Because of the significant human resources required to develop LLMs as powerful as
ChatGPT and other commercial models, companies have yet again turned to the
cheap workforces in LMICs – especially countries like Kenya, Uganda and India. These
countries are specifically targeted because they often combine highly educated
workforces with extremely high youth unemployment rates, as well as tax incentives
and outdated or lax labour laws. Many young data workers are also lured by the
promise of working on cu$ing edge technology, as Mophat highlighted: “I heard from
my friends that AI is the future of technology, I wanted to be part of it – I was very
curious about what AI is, and what it takes to train AI.”
Unfortunately, the reality of the work was starkly at odds with the premise under
which workers like Mophat were hired, by intermediaries such as Sama, themselves
hired by organisations in the US recruiting anonymously on behalf of big commercial
LLM companies. Firstly, Mophat’s dream of feeling part of something big and
exciting, and opportunities to upskill in a cu$ing-edge field, were hindered by the
fact that workers are provided with no context for the work they are doing, often

Additionally, the work itself was unreliable in terms of its frequency and duration,

with projects starting and stopping at a moment’s notice, and either poorly paid, or
unpaid, based on spurious reasons. More egregiously, Mophat talked of the mental
and emotional toll of data annotation, which involved labelling images of abuse or
violence – causing nightmares and affective issues with a worker’s children or family
members. Even where organizations provide mental health support to workers,
counsellors are not experienced enough in the impact of data-annotation induced
trauma to provide adequate help.
This impact is not unique to commercial LLM supply chains. Maria, who is involved in
data annotation to make a commercial LLM more safe and relevant for young female
South African users of the Big Sis chatbot, also spoke of the huge weight of
responsibility she and her colleagues have faced in making decisions as a ‘mother of
AI’. Whereas Mophat spoke of feeling divorced from the impact of his work because
of explicit efforts to keep workers in the dark, in-house data annotators can have an
all-too strong connection to their work’s potential impact.
For example, Maria spoke of the worry and guilt that could be caused by the
knowledge that her decisions might end up directly shaping a GenAI powered
response to, say, a young woman seeking help with the decision to terminate a
pregnancy. Not only should this enormous responsibility be reflected in the status
(and therefore pay) of data annotators, including at a smaller scale, but processes
should also be put in place to prepare and support them to shoulder this burden on
an ongoing basis.
Frameworks and tools to assess and
respond to labour abuses
Our discussion moved on to focus on what could be done to address these
problematic issues – either when choosing which LLMs to work with, or when
conducting data annotation in-house.
Oǧuz spoke of the Fairwork action-research project, which aims to highlight the best
and worst examples of how technology supply chains impact workers, and
offers core principles developed in conversation with scholars, policy makers and
https://merltech.org/resources/in-house-data-annotation-best-practice-principles-developed-by-mti/ Page 5 of 10 In-house data annotation best practice principles developed by MTI - MERL Tech 10/3/25, 12:33 PM
workers themselves. These principles are then used to publicly hold companies
accountable. To date, Fairwork has evaluated digital labour conditions in 40 countries
and produced over 700 platform ratings including Uber, or JustEat as well as AI
intermediary companies like Sama.

We also spoke of the delicate process of engaging with companies held up to
scrutiny and doing justice to the demands and needs of workers they speak to. Oǧuz
shared a case study involving Sama, the same company Mophat had worked for.
Fairworks presented Sama with a ‘preliminary assessment’ based on desk research,
interviews with workers and conversations with Sama managers. Two points were
awarded for each of Fairwork’s 5 principles, based on issues such as unpaid overtime,
short term contracts, dangerous levels of job strain and excessive workplace
surveillance. Sama received a score of 0 out of 10.
Sama showed willingness to engage and make changes, which did result in a 15% pay
rise to the base salaries of almost 4,000 workers and improved access to
psychological help – leading them to a score of 5 out of 10 (a 10/10 score is
considered the ‘bare minimum’ in terms of rights-respecting workplace). Indeed,
Mophat earlier mentioned that many Sama workers felt that the changes introduced
https://merltech.org/resources/in-house-data-annotation-best-practice-principles-developed-by-mti/ Page 6 of 10 In-house data annotation best practice principles developed by MTI - MERL Tech 10/3/25, 12:33 PM
by Sama were insufficient to merit a 5 out of 10. Oǧuz agreed with this and used it as
an example to illustrate the importance of ongoing, repeated assessments on AI
supply chains.
Ultimately, Oǧuz stressed Fairwork’s plan to move from evaluating intermediaries,
including recruitment companies that handle the advertising and allocation of digital
work like data annotation or content moderation, to holding the ‘lead firms’
accountable too. These large companies often hide their involvement via multiple
layers of outsourcing. They, however, are the ones who ultimately define the working
conditions through their budget stipulations, timeframes, limitations on workers’
rights via NDAs, and lack of upskilling opportunities.
Calls to action to improve data
annotation conditions
Fairwork’s global work will inevitably take time to move the needle, as it involves
holding hugely powerful firms and complex systems accountable in a meaningful and
enduring way. But closer to home, we may have more opportunities to improve
working conditions for data annotators, starting with providing mental health
support as standard. There is a tendency when working with new technologies to
take a blank-slate approach, when actually what’s needed is a doubling-down on
existing best practices when it comes to workers’ rights.
One simple step we can take is also to prioritise opportunities for education,
upskilling, and certification. Mophat also stressed how important it is to educate
workers not only about their rights but about the existence and benefits of
organizing via trade unions such as Tech Worker Community Africa. Data workers
need to be made aware of their own value in terms of the crucial role they are playing
in developing AI models which ultimately enrich a few billionaires in the Global North
and be given recognition for the complex skills they have developed (from scratch!).
Mophat mentioned how frequently data workers are left ‘stranded’ with nothing to
show for their unique experiences.

These final calls to action should be heard by those of us working directly with
young people who may themselves be tempted by data annotation roles in their
respective countries. It is becoming clearer and clearer that anyone involved in using
an LLM to power their digital interventions has a responsibility to simultaneously
educate their audience members on the risks associated with the wider phenomenon
of AI – whether that means using it or participating in some way in its development.
