Responsible Contracting Standard,TechEquity,https://techequity.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Summary-Report-Contract-Worker-Disparity-Project.pdf,Standards,NGO/non profit (other),Contract workers generally,United States,01-01-2022,techequity.txt,"﻿Despite a worldwide pandemic that dramatically widened income inequality, pushed women out of the workplace, and disproportionately harmed low-wage workers, the tech industry and its profits have only grown. Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla and Facebook added a combined $2.9 trillion to their
collective market caps in 2021 and each has individually reached $1T or more in market cap in 2021 alone1. From the biggest players in the market to future forecasted unicorns, there are no signs of slowing growth.
But the widespread perception that tech workers have prospered over the last 18 months isn’t a fully accurate depiction. The reality is that many who work in tech—the temporary, contract, and contingent workers who are classified differently from their directly-employed counterparts despite performing critical roles for the companies—have been locked out of tech’s prosperity.
The prevalence and scale of contingent employment has grown steadily over the past several years, outpacing direct employment at major companies like Google, which in March 2019 employed 121,000 contract workers and 102,000 direct employees2. In the course of our research, TechEquity found evidence that contract workers are less likely to benefit from the traditional pathways into the tech industry and are more likely to belong to underrepresented racial, ethnic, and gender groups than the direct tech workforce.
The Contract Worker Disparity Project is a comprehensive look at the conditions that create these inequities. Through a first-of-its-kind survey, first person interviews, and an in-depth literary and data review, we've uncovered several key themes that typified the contract worker experience:
1. A dual management structure that prevents opportunity for advancement - Contingent workers have a fragmented reporting structure: their day-to-day work is overseen by a manager at the
parent (tech) company while the operational aspects of their employment—pay, benefits, and legal protections—are the purview of the staffing agency that hired them. These two management structures rarely coordinate. Contractors reported that navigating this structure made it harder to do good work and to advocate for themselves. Although this practice is set up to protect tech companies from liability, it often leads to disempowerment for the worker.
2. Job precarity - Contracting roles typically start as a three- to six- month engagement and are extended or terminated based on the whims of the parent company. Contract workers lack insight into why their contracts may not be extended, and potential for their extension is tenuous and never guaranteed. At any moment their role can be cut or they can be let go without warning, leaving them without an income or protections.
3. A lack of voice in the workplace - Because of this precarity, which allows parent companies to not renew contracts at any time for any reason, workers are afraid to speak up against workplace harassment or other injustices. Additionally, they are concerned with being deemed “difficult to work with” as this impedes their potential for contract extension or transition to direct employment.
4. Unequal pay for equal work - Contract workers are often performing the same job functions as
their directly-employed peers—but getting paid less for the same work. For example, 75% of software developer contract workers who completed TechEquity’s survey are in the the 25th percentile or lower for average earnings across the industry overall.
5. An overrepresentation of certain racial and gender groups in job classifications —otherwise known as occupational segregation—with little power and comparatively low pay - In every dataset that TechEquity examined, one fact was glaringly obvious—contract work in tech is disproportionately done by people from under-represented racial, ethnic, and gender groups. Coupled with the lack of representation in the direct tech workforce, the practice of contracting out sets the conditions for occupational segregation.
Ultimately, these themes show heightened power differentials between contract and direct workers; contract workers and staffing agencies; and contract workers and tech companies.
This report is a comprehensive account of TechEquity’s findings—issued throughout 2021 in four papers on the working conditions, career mobility, business model, and worker demographics of the contract work phenomena. Synthesizing public datasets, independent research, legal and regulatory landscapes, intel from
industry insiders, and hundreds of firsthand worker accounts, the findings make the case that while workers value the opportunity to work in a desirable industry, corporate and policy changes are necessary to ensure that the workers powering tech profits benefit from the industry’s growth.












Understanding the Practice of “Contracting Out”










Why do tech companies use contracting agencies?


The use of contracting agencies to fill staffing needs has become increasingly popular across all industries as part of a larger trend to cut costs and
increase shareholder value. But this practice has been particularly appealing to Silicon Valley companies who have an imperative (driven by the demands of venture capital investors) to gain massive market share and valuation as quickly as possible.
________________
In this dynamic, growing employee headcounts are seen as a drag on value. LinkedIn Founder and
prominent Silicon Valley investor Reid Hoffman, in his influential book Blitzscaling, refers to employees as “growth limiters” and encourages companies “to find ways to outsource work to contractors or suppliers.”3




These growth and speed imperatives get built into day-to-day business practices. Today, different companies— and even departments or teams within each company—provide different reasons for using contracting agencies to bring on workers. Here is how they articulate their reliance on contracting:


1. Streamlined hiring processes
At most large companies, adding full-time, direct employees requires multiple levels of sign-off, budgetary allocations, and often numerous reviews and approvals. For many teams, it is much simpler to use their
discretionary or general budget to engage a contracting agency to increase the number of workers on a project or team quickly.
2. Flexible capacity for temporary needs Companies might choose to use a contracting agency to cover for direct employees who are on leave, or for temporary projects, or ones that do not have long-term funding.
________________
3. Securing services that aren’t core to the business
Companies often hire out services—like catering, facilities operations, or similar—that are ancillary to the business and that other firms have greater expertise to provide.
4. “Fee-for-service” labor backfill
Companies contract with large agencies and consulting companies (who often subcontract to regional or off-shore companies) for services that are performed on an hourly and volumetric basis such as content moderation and social media policy adherence.


A brief history of contract work in the U.S.
Contracting agencies have become deeply embedded in the American economy over the last several decades. The practice of shifting portions of the labor force from direct employment to the payrolls of contracting agencies began after World War II. The staffing industry billed itself as being able to fulfill flexible, temporary roles with “ideal” employees—without the long-term commitment to an individual worker of a family-sustaining income or other benefits. According to the American Staffing Association, the practice of “contracting out” has been growing steadily—the industry closed out 2020 with a 175% revenue increase over its 2003 total.
Contracting agencies (and what is often called temporary work) took off during the mid-twentieth
century with the concept of a “Kelly Girl5,” a housewife with “extra time on her hands” who was looking for a foothold in the labor market at a time when direct employment was reserved for white men.
Job seekers likely to face discrimination in the workforce found a modicum of stability in substandard employment arrangements, and the modern contract work model and its embedded inequity was born. (Kelly Services remains a leader in today’s contract work/temporary work industry.)


There are three main ways these agencies function inside of tech
* Staffing - A tech firm contracts with a staffing agency to supply the tech company with a specific set of workers for a project, a division, or a type of work that the tech company is not going to hire directly. Often these firms fill a range of roles including analysts, reception, operations, content moderation, call centers, and so on.
* Payroll - A tech firm contracts with a payroll agency for the sole purpose of paying tech company contractors and serving as the employer of record. The payroll agency will handle all tax forms, direct deposit, legal compliance, and so on for the employee but does not provide recruiting, management, or regular oversight.
* Service - A tech firm contracts with a service agency to provide a specific service and will also hire, manage, and be responsible for all of the employees that provide that service. Service agencies are also commonly referred to as vendors. Often vendors are janitorial companies, landscaping services, cafeteria workers, etc. While vendor employees are not excluded from TechEquity’s research, our findings are primarily based on the experiences of workers hired through staffing or payroll agencies.










Disparities start in the procurement process
Understanding how departments budget for labor reveals that there are also systemic factors causing contractor instability. Generally, department leaders and hiring managers often have two ways to increase staffing: hiring direct employees (personnel budget) or hiring contract workers (general operating budget or discretionary budget). Because speed and agility are highly valued in tech companies, many team leads and contracting managers have an incentive to bring in workers faster and under non-committal terms.
General operating funds are not steady year over year, which accounts for one reason that contract roles aren’t steady either.
________________
A number of the conditions that contract workers will experience are set from the start by the procurement process. TechEquity spoke to tech managers who explained that they hire contract workers by writing a staffing proposal that’s then executed by the company procurement teams. That team is responsible for selecting the contracting agencies and the terms of their service.
Those processes award funding to the “most competitive” bid—a practice that typically rewards proposals that offer to deliver a qualified labor pool for the least amount of money, resulting in a race to
the bottom on cost rather than equitable outcomes for the workers. While the total amount can look sufficient enough to give workers family-supporting incomes, the cut that contracting agencies take out to cover their own costs and profits brings workers’ earnings down. Often, the amount the contracting agencies take from the contracts is obscured from the tech companies. Tech company managers reported being surprised with the reality of low contract worker wages based on the high cost of their agreements with contracting agencies.
A TechEquity review of tech contracting Requests for Proposals (“RFPs”) found solicitations that emphasize selecting for cost-competitiveness and agencies that can provide high-caliber employees willing to go above and beyond to provide a great service. Those RFPs did not also ask contracting agencies to submit their wage standards, overtime rates and process, benefits packages, turnover rates, management evaluation and training process, or other details that would indicate a contracting agency's ability to hire,
________________
cultivate, and retain a first-class workforce. The final agreements successfully shield companies from the personnel decisions made by contracting agencies: agencies make sure the workers arrive when requested, and the companies assume they’re taking care of the rest.
The tech company saves on the cost of benefits by using an agency, but more so than cost savings the real motivation for the company appears to be flexibility. During a time in which economic
uncertainty continues to flourish across industries, a February 2021 study from the Bureau of Labor Statistics6 (“BLS”) found that labor trends in temporary help services7, under which contract
workers fall per BLS definitions, predict employment trends in the larger economy. When departmental budgets look uncertain or suddenly shrink, there is a class of workers, never fully integrated into the larger office culture, who can easily be let go tomorrow.
Increased demand for contracting agencies; falling wages for workers


The simple narrative that contract work saves money—rather than shifts who pays the costs— downplays the profit that contracting agencies generate from the model. The initial pitch in the post- war workforce trumpeted cost savings—by offering lower wages than those of direct workers and foregoing benefits, onboarding, and recruiting costs, the company can improve its bottom line. Research on today’s contract work environment indicates
that tech companies often pay contracting
________________
agencies enough for the agencies to o""er family- supporting wages. To ensure their profit margin, however, the agency takes a major cut of its workers’ earnings.
TechEquity has confirmed that contracting agencies often take upward of 30% of the money they receive from the tech company in recruiting and contracting fees.  
Across the contracting industry, mark ups can be as high as 100%8 of a contract worker’s wages.
Conversations with contract workers, contracting agency staff, and direct tech employees indicate that the agencies pocket between 20—50% of the total contract amounts, but the vast number of agencies and roles suggests there is even more variation in how much the agencies profit.
________________
BLS data on temporary help services, or supplemental workforce, suggests that demand for contract work in skilled industries is increasing, and becoming more profitable for the contracting agencies. Increasing revenue for contracting agencies, however, does not translate to higher contract worker incomes.
The latest numbers from the American Staffing Association10 show that, even despite a small dip due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the contracting agency industry ended 2020 having increased revenues 175% over the past two decades. There is a similar dip and rebound around the 2008 recession; despite market uncertainty, demand for contracting agencies has consistently increased.
Lack of transparent and accessible data leads to  an ever-invisible workforce


While we know that the contract workforce is increasing, sussing out the true disparities in worker wages and the company profit margins is challenging. Drawing similarities for pay parity is reliant on patchwork, imprecise, and non- parallel job categorization. This means there is no comprehensive view of contract worker
wages in tech as an industry. Staffing and temp agencies report the job categories (e.g. office and
________________
administrative support, construction, etc.) of the employees they place, not the industries in which they are placed.
Of the hundreds of workers who submitted information in first person interviews and our survey, over 30% who responded about their job category provided a job type outside of our thirteen-category list. Within that group, few listed the same jobs, pointing to the sprawling and sometimes disparate
job categories across the contract workforce. Because BLS tracks what contract workers (listed under the BLS “temporary help services
classification”) do— not necessarily the employer or industry for which they do it—people who work on contract in operations, marketing, administrative services, etc. within tech do not show up in the data.
________________
Even those in typical tech roles, such as software development, could be working in government, nonprofit, for academic institutions. The data does not give an industry-wide picture, consequently concealing the significance of tech’s reliance on contingent workers.
Firewalls between companies and workers paradoxically increases liability


When it comes to making data-driven decisions, tech companies are in the dark, too. They mandate the number of people the agency must hire and the total contract amount, but most don’t set a wage rate within the contract—either for the contract workers or the contracting agency workers whose earnings also come out of the same funding.
Such corporate practice here can once again be explained, in part, by the delicate legal balance tech companies must strike to employ contract workers. When two or more businesses co-determine or share control over a worker’s terms of employment (such as pay, schedules, and job duties), then both businesses may be considered to be employers of that worker, or “joint employers.” Joint employers are responsible, both individually and jointly, to employees for compliance with worker protection laws11.
Tech companies avoid, at all costs, being considered joint employers for contract workers. The contracting agencies are sole employers who ostensibly direct all elements of the contract worker’s employment. To avoid triggering a joint employer finding, corporate policies keep contract workers structurally isolated—without a clear manager,
________________
without a clear pathway into direct employment, without direct access to necessary resources and tools for their work— in order to limit company liability.
To keep it that way, companies create arm’s-length policies for those workers; they also change their personnel practices altogether. If the responsibilities and daily tasks of contract workers are largely indistinguishable from directly-employed workers, that can also trigger a joint employment finding. To avoid that, some companies have phased out integrated teams—a mix of full-time employees and contract workers, which used to be common practice. Now certain core business functions are fulfilled entirely by contract worker teams, while others are done by direct employees.
For the tech companies, the proliferation of second- rate employment, without regular reporting from the contracting agencies, presents risks —low worker morale is bad for business. In recent years, contract workers have sued12, walked out13, and organized14 over their treatment, pulling companies into the spotlight and questioning their reputations
as great places to work.
Beyond public relations considerations, current contract worker practices are a drain on productivity, and ultimately tech’s bottom line. Report after
report finds that happy workers are better workers, with some research finding them to be 31% more productive15 and 19% more accurate on task completion.
Tech companies have a natural incentive to advocate for and enforce better contract worker practices.
________________
The risks are many: litigation16 (joint-employment standard and co-employment generally arises from mistreated workers, inequitable pay and benefits, and substandard working conditions), fiduciary responsibility to mitigate the profit loss17 that results from misclassifying workers, the reputational risk18, product harm19 from employing a homogenous workforce, not to mention that attracting and retaining talent is one of the core drivers and predictors of business success.




Moreover, the demographic differences between contract workers and direct employees, as well as the pay and demographic disparities between payroll agency contract workers and staffing agency contract workers, could invite disparate impact claims and other legal scrutiny. The disparate impact20 legal standard holds that employers are responsible for practices that create different outcomes for groups based on their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin even if those practices are applied neutrally, or irrespective of those
characteristics. There could be issues of employment discrimination if hiring practices result in discriminatory outcomes, including workers with protected class status21 disproportionately assigned to lower paid roles.


Connecting with workers + our major findings
To understand the worker experience, TechEquity interviewed over 30 current and former contract workers, and ran a survey with 34 questions, with both qualitative and quantitative responses (more information in the methodology section of this paper).
Across sources and surveys, certain findings are consistent:
* Contract workers of color are more likely to be paid hourly than annually, and to receive lower pay than white workers: 39% of contractors of color are paid annually, compared to 45% of white contractors with the majority of contractors of color earning in the $50-85K range, compared to the majority of white contractors earning in the $85-120K range.
* Contract workers of color are less likely to be converted to direct employment than white contract workers: 41% of respondents who were people of color said they never converted to direct employment compared to 31% of white respondents.
* Contract workers receive fewer benefits than direct tech workers: 33% of survey respondents received no benefits, compared to just 23% of private-industry workers22 who do not have paid vacation or sick leave.
* People of color are overrepresented in contract roles compared to the overall tech workforce: 44% of contractors are people of color vs. 31% in the direct workforce.
Different outreach methodologies produced different results—on the pay, backgrounds, and experiences of contract workers. The variations in responses points to the difficulty in sampling vulnerable and underrepresented workers in a vast, homogenous industry. It also underscores the need for public, vetted, and consistent datasets on this population.

Who Becomes a Contract Worker?










Contract workers are not your average tech worker


Many people have a very specific idea in mind when they think of the usual tech worker: most likely a young, white man, with a degree from a certain institution and connected to the industry through a vast network of personal and academic connections who lit the path to his $146,000/year23 desk job.
This common perception—while maybe a useful control variable for understanding some of
________________
the industry’s inequities—overgeneralizes the characteristics of tech’s emergent workforce. Responses to a survey conducted as part of the Contract Worker Disparity Project—the most comprehensive survey of tech’s shadow workforce— reveal that contract workers, like the prototypical tech worker, disproportionately hold four-year and advanced degrees, but most other commonalities end there.




Contract workforce is significantly more diverse than tech’s full-time workforce
Data and analysis from Project Include24 and TechEquity’s contract worker survey indicates that the demographic trends of the contingent workforce at tech companies—those who are hired through and employed by third-party entities, often on tenuous contracts—differ substantially from the directly employed workforce.
Contract and temp workers are more likely to be Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian, women, and nonbinary people than those hired in the direct workforce.
For every single racialized category, the rate of employment in contract work was greater than the rate of employment of those same racialized groups in directly employed roles at the tech company. In short, contract workers are the closest thing tech has to a diverse and representative workforce.




These disparities also exist across gender. According to our in-house survey, 60% of survey respondents were women and 5.8% nonbinary, genderqueer, or gender fluid; 32% were men.
Reliable data on the number and rates of gender-expansive people in America are still emerging, with one recent study26 finding there to be 1.2 million nonbinary people, or 0.004% of the total U.S. population, while other data indicate that 5% of startup workers are nonbinary27—though this doesn’t incorporate the employees who chose not to answer to protect their privacy.
Direct employment opportunities are not the only area where workers of color, women, and nonbinary people experience disparate treatment. Preliminary data and contract workers’ descriptions of their job functions support assertions that they perform similar work as direct employees—for a fraction of the pay.


Of the software developer respondents who disclosed salary information, just 25% reported earning $86,000 a year or more, putting 75% of those contract workers in the lowest-paid 25th percentile28 of software developers according to 2019 analysis by U.S. News and World Report.
To the extent that tech has diversified since 2014, it has done so by keeping its direct employee statistics in stasis while disproportionately hiring people of color, women, and nonbinary workers into lower-paying, more precarious contract roles that offer much less opportunity for career advancement.
The Contract Worker Experience










Landing a contract role is a crooked path to tech  employment


Landing a job at a tech company promises high wages, stability, innumerable benefits and upward mobility.
However, finding and getting an offer for these roles is notoriously competitive. For many job-seekers who aspire to work in tech, getting a foot in the door by way of contract work can seem like an accessible onramp to a competitive field, especially for those from underrepresented groups who often face steeper barriers to entry.
________________
Often, tech contract workers are proactively recruited by contracting agencies. Someone who wasn’t necessarily looking for a new job gets a LinkedIn message (or is stopped by a recruiter on their college campus, or sees an ad on social media) offering employment in an aspirational industry.
From there, the contract worker typically goes through a round of interviews with a combination of contracting agency and tech company staff before being brought on for a contract—often set at six months or less.




Contracting agency business model keeps wages low


The contracting agency model can reinforce disparate earnings even when the tech company intervenes.
One worker who spoke to TechEquity reported that their tech company offered them a $10-an-hour raise. Soon after, the worker’s contracting agency let them know there was an issue implementing the
raise because doing so would mean the money would come out of the earnings of staff at the contracting agency. It took several weeks for the tech company manager and contracting agency to iron it out; when they did, it didn’t include back pay for the delay period.
________________
The contract workers who have spoken to TechEquity
consistently report low-quality relationships with their contracting agencies. Some struggled to remember the names of their agencies, having to consult their pay stubs to jog their memories.
Others shared that they didn’t hear from the agency for the duration of their contracts after they signed. The colleagues that share daily experiences and struggles work in teams alongside each other, but may be employed by different agencies and receive different levels of employer support, making it hard for workers to band together to advocate for themselves.
Dual management structure leads to confusing expectations
Contract workers have two official management relationships: with their contracting agency and with their company supervisors. The contracting agency frequently covers performance feedback (provided from the tech company to the contracting agency, then to the contract worker), time off requests, payroll, and HR functions. The tech manager, most often a direct employee of the tech company, oversees their day-to-day work and determines whether their contracts are extended.
The dual management structure is designed to minimize the tech company’s liability; the more direct
________________
the relationship is between a contract worker and a tech company, the more at risk the company is of
being legally indistinguishable from a direct employer. This practice stems from a lawsuit brought by temps at Microsoft 29who argued they should receive the same benefits as full-time employees since they were essentially doing the same jobs. The courts agreed.
Instead of encouraging tech companies to treat more of these roles as full-time positions, the companies have increased their reliance on the practice while at the same time instituting the Kafka-esque reporting structure that protects them from legal exposure but disempowers the workers.










In practice, reporting to two entities leaves workers without the support they need to perform their roles. Myriad actors working together from separate offices requires timely and coordinated communication, as well as regular training for tech managers to understand how to supervise hybrid teams of direct and contract workers. Many of the workers we interviewed detailed that they reported to a series of tech managers during their contracts, with many stepping into the role with seemingly minimal knowledge of the unique legal and company rules that applied to their direct reports. This results in inconsistency in how well the tech managers and the hiring a
It becomes the contract workers’ obligation to piece together expectations from the tech company and contracting agency when they fail to collaborate.
One worker shared that early during the COVID-19 pandemic, they and their fellow contract workers hadn’t received information on how their benefits, including their right to sick leave, had changed with new federal and state laws. They tracked down the appropriate legal information and shared it with their fellow contract workers. When their managers found out, they were scolded.
They were told that the information needed to come from each workers’ contracting agency directly,
________________
even though weeks had already gone by without employers disclosing the news of their legal rights to the contract workers. Critical information gets lost in a dual reporting structure, leaving workers to use valuable time tracking down the appropriate authority—and to be reprimanded for not obeying
the often invisible lines of who is responsible for what.
According to our interviews and in-house survey data, there are three common expectations tech workers have when deciding to take a contract role: 1. getting hired as a direct employee, 2. leveraging the industry’s reputation, and 3. earning experience they can apply elsewhere.






Louisa's Story
Louisa* (name changed for anonymity) accepted a position working on public policy at a major tech company. She learned quickly, however, that the duties her contracting agency hired her to fulfill actually conflicted with the tech company’s internal rules precluding her from certain
activities critical to her job, such as speaking on behalf of the company and managing relationships with external partners. Despite numerous requests to her tech manager to clarify how she should navigate the company’s internal rules and still fulfill her role, Louisa received no guidance. She
was assigned ad hoc tasks, but was never given a clear metric for how she could meet or exceed expectations. She sensed that her first manager didn’t understand how to apply the company’s contractor policies well enough to revise Louisa’s job scope.
Adding to her difficulties, that manager was later replaced with someone who had even less information on Louisa’s role. Louisa then had to rebuild the relationship with the person who could extend her contracts and help her convert to direct employment—without a clear sense of what management needed from her in the first place.
Ambiguous jobs aren’t uncommon even for direct employees. For Louisa, however, this haziness threatened her livelihood; contracts are often extended just a few months at a time and can end immediately without notice. By workers’ own characterizations, their experiences and satisfaction as contract workers are determined by the daily precarity of their jobs.
Conversion from contract to full-time is rare, but it's why workers take contract positions
Nearly unanimously in our interviews and in-house survey data, contract workers cited their intention to convert to direct employment as the key reason for accepting precarious jobs. Even if a temporary or contract role wouldn’t provide access to robust compensation and benefits packages, workers held out hope that taking a precarious contract role could crack the door open to direct employment in the future. However, more than 77% of contract workers we spoke to did not convert to direct employment.
Converting from contract to direct employment is uncommon, and most contract workers we
interviewed were not explicitly told that conversion to a full-time position was highly unlikely when they took the position. Contract workers enter their roles aspiring to get hired on permanently, or to
________________
benefit from being a part of a company with name recognition where they can learn new skills that provide a foothold into new fields. For many, those hopes are quickly dashed.
One of the few workers we spoke to who successfully became a direct employee attributed their success to the happenstance of attending the same meeting as a powerful company executive early in their contract; seated next to each other, they eventually found out that the two did similar work early in their careers. When the contract worker directly asked about open positions, the executive asked for their resume. The worker sent it to the executive; though it was still over a year later, as the worker’s contract was expiring, they eventually secured a direct employment position.


In the absence of company conversion policies, pathways into stable employment hinge
on interpersonal relationships rather than standardized and transparent processes. This informality creates the same dynamics that cause the tech workforce as a whole to be so homogeneous:
________________
white people and men are more likely to thrive in the dominant tech culture and parlay their contract role into direct employment. Employers can set realistic expectations from the outset and curb hiring bias
by creating formal, written conversion policies for contract workers.
Contract work limits job mobility across the career ladder
Beyond mobility limitations from contract to direct employee, contract workers face strict policies and procedures that limit their future job searches. The majority of workers who spoke to TechEquity told us that they were not supposed to list or reference the tech company on their resumes or job applications. Instead, they were instructed to say, for example, “Recruiting Manager for Pro Unlimited [contracting company] at Uber [tech company].”
One worker shared that their contract experience actually put them at a disadvantage for direct employment opportunities. During the interview process for a full-time tech role at a different company, a hiring panel saw contract employment on their resume and pivoted to discussing other contract work opportunities, instead of the full-time position for which
they had applied.
Told to downplay their connection to the tech companies, contract workers either comply and suffer the hiring disadvantages, or go against corporate instructions to gain some benefit from their work experiences. Many contract workers reported doing the latter. It’s a gamble with consequences: recruiters confirmed to TechEquity that those who decide to list the tech companies as their employers are passed over or disadvantaged for other contract work openings.
Workers leverage their experience—despite barriers


Despite receiving little to no explicit or intentional on-the-job training, the immense responsibilities
workers fulfill on the periphery of the tech workforce leave them with skills they can apply elsewhere.
Even with the many barriers to mobility, virtually all workers who spoke to TechEquity directly said
they would recommend contract work to a friend— with disclaimers. Many wish they had understood that these are dead-end roles when they signed up. Others thought it was critical that contract workers understand how undervalued and separated they would be from their directly-employed colleagues.
Yet even that is hard-earned. Contract workers are often unable to present their work product, access necessary tools and documents, or demonstrate their abilities to company decision-makers.
At large companies, contract workers reported that they had to ask a direct employee (any direct employee, not necessarily their tech supervisor) for entry to company intranet systems that housed work files. The policy that keeps contract workers from certain internal company meetings also leaves them unable to personally present their work to
certain audiences. In this scenario direct employees are responsible for sharing their colleagues’ work with other teams, denying contract workers the opportunity to demonstrate their value and gain the visibility required for future conversion or career opportunities.
________________
In the end, those who have moved on from contracting are often in roles that they enjoy more and earn more than before they worked in tech; it’s a stepping stone to better employment—with some company, if not the one that initially hired them.
Without evident and universal conversion protocols, the de facto pathways into direct employment
favor those who already have connections and commonalities with the existing tech workforce. Formalized conversion processes that look at work performance would help contract workers understand their likelihood of converting before accepting the roles and would make it more likely
that diverse employees advance in the tech industry.
The precarity and lack of mobility that characterizes contract work is a particular problem as it serves to reinforce and exacerbate the racial wealth gap.






















As a [direct worker] you have full access to all documents, all the systems. As a [contract worker], even though you’re doing the work and expected to do the work…we have to request special access
for [contract workers] to actually do the work we’re required to do, because we’re treated different in terms of security for access to different technical systems.”

Disparate Experiences Lead to Disparate Impacts


Across companies and roles, the Contract Worker Disparity Project found several key themes that typified the contract worker experience:
* A dual management structure that impedes work performance
* Heightened power differentials between contract worker and direct workers, contract workers and contracting agencies, and contract workers and tech companies
* Job precarity
* A lack of a voice in the workplace
* Unequal pay for equal work
* An overrepresentation of certain racial and gender groups in a job classification with little power and comparatively low pay




Exacerbating disparities leads to occupational segregation


The concentration of certain demographic groups in job classifications with less power and lower wages looks a lot like occupational segregation30.
Occupational segregation creates a structure where it becomes even easier to construct gender and racial pay gaps. When certain demographic groups (Black, Latinx, Indigenous, Asian, women, and nonbinary) hold an outsized number of certain types of jobs (tech contract roles), there is a structure
to pay workers differently while attributing it to different skill or responsibility levels than if all worker groups were equally represented in each field and classification.
Data shows that this is the case even when performing the same functions. That’s why 75% of software developer contract workers who completed TechEquity’s survey are in the the 25th percentile or lower for average earnings. One’s status as a contract worker is used to justify unequal pay for equal work, leaving underrepresented tech workers concentrated in the worker groups with the least power.

TechEquity has shown elsewhere in the Contract Worker Disparity Project31 series that contract workers receive a fraction of the benefits of direct employees. In addition to health care and paid time off, the typical tech benefits package includes stock options. The latest numbers32 from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that private-sector employers spend about 29.4% of total compensation costs
on an employee’s benefits. Put another way, direct employees earn about 30% more than their base pay in various benefits. The total value of higher wages and better benefits make the pay disparities between direct tech employees and contract workers even more severe.








  

Unpredictable employment creates precarity and silences  contract worker voice
With all of the disparities a contract worker faces, it can be easy to wonder why they don’t speak out against these harms. Contract workers reported to
TechEquity that they don’t feel empowered to speak out because their tenure can often be precarious and unpredictable. They sign an initial contract, frequently for a six-month term, and then have their jobs extended in repeated, shorter increments. Contract extension is never guaranteed. Employers tout the flexibility that this affords the workers, as they are
not beholden to the company for more than a few months at a time.
________________
However, this flexibility more often benefits the employer than the worker. Tech managers are empowered to end contracts at any time, for any reason, whether it be disappointing performance or personal bias. Though the contracts cover a specific time period, employers (and workers) have the ability to end the contracts without advanced notice or explanation. The contract workers we spoke to reported receiving little to no information about why their contracts end early. This heightens the existing power differential between workers and supervisors by compelling contract workers’ acceptance of
poor working conditions and treatment in order to preserve the income supporting their families.




Dat's Story
Dat* (name changed for anonymity) was excited to make a career pivot into working for a tech start-up, having always wanted to be a part of a small team of ambitious but down-to-earth colleagues. What they found, however, was a new version of the old boys club.
“It was always so uncomfortable. I always felt like there was such a divide. I thought that, ‘oh well eventually they’re going to hire me on permanently, or eventually the team is going to warm up to me.’ But no, I always felt like an outsider.”
The final straw came when Dat was prevented from attending the company’s remote retreat— which Dat had planned. Not only did they miss out on the four-figure bonus that everyone else received, they missed out on a formative bonding experience with their colleagues. “At that point I was just like, ‘oh, I will never be a part of this team. Like ever.’” Dat’s company ended their contract less than a year later. A former colleague later shared with Dat that their contract was ended because the team didn’t feel like they “clicked.”
In some cases, workers report being told after the fact that their contracts were extended, depriving them of the chance to discuss wage increases or better benefits. Because their supervisors retain all power to extend or cancel contracts with no stated rationale, speaking up about workplace issues can mean risking one’s economic security and opportunities for future employment.
When one worker confided in a directly-employed colleague who shared their experience of discrimination in the workplace, the colleague told the worker to not bother taking it to HR—
________________
a familiar sentiment for those whose identities have not always been respected in the office culture HR is perceived to protect.
Workers confirmed that when workplace issues arise, they wouldn’t go through the established reporting structures because they had seen that very few concerns were meaningfully addressed that way.
Instead they felt that utilizing that process was more likely to anger their supervisor who might fire them or fail to renew their contract with no warning or recourse.


Contract workers and direct employees are separate and unequal


In the summer of 2020 when workers across the country started having conversations about structural inequality and white supremacy in the workplace, contract workers were largely
prohibited from participating. Their contract status frequently bars them from participating in All Hands meetings, or other team building and office culture opportunities.
The practices that companies use to keep contract workers legally distinct (and shield themselves from the legal responsibilities of direct employment) promote the two-tiered worker hierarchy often referred to as tech’s caste system33. The separation of workers affects everything from cafeteria access, shuttle service, and company-wide meeting privileges to contract workers’ access to internal intranet systems and even certain team meetings.
________________
One worker experiencing intense discrimination
and hostility from his managers received no support from his contracting agency when he reached
out. Later, when he escalated the matter up the organizational hierarchy, he was told that there are recourse procedures for how to deal with such issues in the tech company’s personnel policies—but those documents were kept in an intranet system that contract workers weren’t allowed to access.
In addition to creating business inefficiencies, segregating necessary job resources encourages a cultural hierarchy amongst colleagues. Many workers reported that power differentials between workers caused friction that ultimately impeded their ability to complete their work.  
The impact of tech labor practices reach far beyond the industry


Increasingly, the rank-and-file behind tech’s most profitable companies are pushed down the
continuum of job quality; workers are downgraded from well-paying, full-time jobs with benefits and protections, to underpaid and unprotected roles, outsourced either into vulnerable classifications or communities that lack worker protections. Today’s covetable six-figure tech job with equity options could be tomorrow’s substandard employment arrangement.
Non-U.S.-based workers who spoke to TechEquity revealed that after having their agency contracts suddenly cut short, they were approached
with an opportunity to work for the same U.S.
________________
company, doing the same work—but this time as an independent contractor without minimum
wage protections, and paying an additional fee to a platform like Upwork that the tech company used to assign work.
The shift from direct employment to third-party contract work, and then to more typical independent contracting or gig work, has a downward effect on worker wages broadly. In Beaten Down, Worked
Up, Steven Greenhouse’s book on the history of America’s labor movement, he details how converting what were once full-time, direct employment roles to freelancing affects those still in direct employment, too34.






Eroding labor practices in tech create a downward pressure on worker wages, leaving an increasing number of the workers in a booming industry to earn less than national and global averages.
A recent analysis by HR&A Advisors35 found that tech was responsible for widening the racial income gap by almost $50 billion. Researchers looked at the gap between Black and Latinx workers and their representation in the industry, as well as the misalignment between worker skill and worker classification to arrive at
these figures.


Notably, this study is based on disparities based on race between direct employees, with the total income gap presumably widening when accounting for earnings differences between contract workers and direct employees, especially contract workers with identities at the intersections of multiple forms of oppression.
Everyone loses when labor practices amplify instability. Research on the effects of income inequality points to its role in slowing economic growth37, accelerating segregation38, and destabilizing democracy39 across the globe. Its most direct, material effect is, of course, economic oppression that lessens quality of life for everyone. America’s largest corporations and industries of concentrated wealth play an outsized role in
contributing to economic destabilization—and in fixing it. Contract work is one facet of the degradation of job classifications that includes gig and piecework. In light of the 1999 lawsuit against Microsoft for its illegal use of “permatemps” to avoid paying stock options, health insurance, and retirement benefits40, and more recent news about the prevalence of the contingent workforce powering tech profits, it becomes clear that while temp practices did not originate in the sector, they are being applied in tech to incredibly harmful ends in ways that are likely to affect other industries.
If we take the proliferation of gig work after the Great Recession as a signal of what’s to come, tech’s contract workforce could be on the precipice of considerable growth as we enter a period of economic recovery. As we enter an era characterized by increasing inequality, we need to ensure that workers re-entering the workforce through temp work are not being exploited and that these roles can lead to safe, stable, secure careers.












































































































The Way Forward










As many in the technology sector will tell you: speed, efficiency, and innovation matter. Often, this is
how the move to expand the contract workforce is justified. These arrangements allow a company to quickly scale up a specific type of expertise or fill an immediate need. In practice, however, these
arrangements are often wide-reaching, long-lasting, and inherently exploitative if they are not
managed well.
________________
The move to a large contract workforce allows companies to absolve themselves of legal responsibility to the workers they rely on to make their companies run—both in terms of ongoing employment, wage rates, and benefits, but also in terms of protecting them from sexual harassment, racial discrimination, and ensuring healthy overall working conditions.
In order for contracting to be done ethically and with the best interests of the workers as the primary aim, we need to focus on change in three key areas:
1. Creating and enforcing responsible contracting standards and practices
2. Adopting and implementing public policy that sets a baseline for protections
3. Ensuring contract workers themselves are leading the process to define solutions
































































Closing the Gap: Responsible Contracting Standards










Our research has shown that in order for contract workers and temps to have stable, good jobs we need to set a more comprehensive standard for employers to follow. Our Responsible Contracting Standard lays out the processes and practices that our research shows will create the conditions for contract
________________
workers to have safe, healthy and family-sustaining employment opportunities in the tech industry and beyond. Where possible, we’ve included specific policy language and reference to laws that undergird many of these recommendations.




1. Require family-sustaining pay and benefits
When it comes to ensuring quality pay and benefits for contract workers, tech companies have more power than they realize. The staffing and temp agencies that compete for a lucrative contract with a tech company are usually only required to specify their bill rate in their Requests for Proposal—leaving critical wage and benefits decisions up to the agency. This means wage rates, titles, benefit offerings, paid time off, career supports, and more are left unseen and unscrutinized by tech companies, giving room to agencies to grow their profits at the expense of contract workers.
This gives tech companies the opportunity to require higher standards for worker treatment in their vendor selection process, and raise the bar for working conditions at their company and across the industry.
What tech companies can do
   * Require vendors to provide at minimum a living wage41 for the area in which a contract worker lives or works.
   * Ensure that employees are offered medical, vision, and dental benefits that reflect the minimum value and affordability threshold42 that is offered to direct employees.
   * Demonstrate a commitment to employee wellness by ensuring adequate paid time off (PTO) and parental leave programs43. For workers with part-time or contract time limits, use a formula to calculate pro-rated PTO that would be equivalent to directly-employed workforce PTO benefit.
   * Provide transparency about the terms and conditions of assignments with written notice from the staffing agency that includes: the length of the assignment, safety requirements, certifications, or personal protective equipment needed for a work assignment, the specific criteria for transitioning to permanent employment, and the “spread” between the temp worker’s hourly wage and the hourly charge to the tech (or parent/client) company for their labor. (From Temps in Tech NELP and TWJ Report44)
   * Ensure that agencies use clear contract timelines that include written details of when a contract will be evaluated for renewal, evaluation criteria for renewal, and provide any details on what employees must do to initiate the renewal process.
   * Prohibit contract terms that limit temp workers’ opportunities to obtain permanent employment at a tech (or parent/client) company—or accept employment with a competitor company. (From Temps in Tech NELP and TWJ Report)
   * Implement best practices for predictable scheduling45 and apply components of fair workweek laws46 and current California law for scheduling47 across the contract workforce.




2. Compensate workers with equal pay for equal work
Contract workers are integral to the success of tech companies. They are moderating content,
conducting research, launching marketing campaigns, planning events, and so much more—often
side-by-side with full-time employees. However, these workers—disproportionately Black, Indigenous, brown, women, and nonbinary48—are often paid lower wages and benefits than their directly-employed counterparts. Tech companies must ensure that all of their workers are being valued and paid for the work they do, not just the ones on direct payroll.
What tech companies can do
   * Require reports from staffing agencies that include pay rate by job type; tech companies are already required to report this information49 to state agencies and should be evaluating their contract workforce against their directly-employed workforce to ensure that they are not enacting unequal pay for equal work.
   * Create a clear and transparent process—that is provided in writing to contract workers—to request, approve, and process raises for contract workers.
   * During the Request for Proposal bid process—and routinely as an audit practice—tech companies should ensure that staffing agencies provide equivalent plans for employer-sponsored healthcare to all contract workers.
   * Implement equitable hiring practices50 for direct and contract employees including publishing pay rates in all job descriptions51 and prohibiting the request for salary history52 in the application, interview, or offer stages for a candidate.




































3. Develop protocols to report workplace safety violations and protect contract worker voices
Contract workers are routinely faced with a painful choice between speaking up about abuse and keeping their jobs. Because contract workers rely on contract renewals to maintain economic security, they often feel unable to report workplace harassment and toxic environments.
Without protection against retaliation, contract workers have no avenue to improve their conditions and tech companies have no idea what really goes on in their workplaces. Tech companies must use their power to provide safe, non-retaliatory means for contract workers to raise concerns and create accountability for all responsible parties.
What tech companies can do
   * Develop an independent complaint process, led by contract workers and/or worker organizations, that allows contract workers to confidentially file complaints that are investigated—ideally by a third party— and if complaints are found to be valid, take responsibility to ensure that workers are made whole as a result.
   * Publish and report the abuses of staffing agencies53 to the relevant regulatory body to ensure that the staffing agency is held accountable for wrongdoing.
   * Outline in writing to vendors that the company supports workers' right to organize, to utilize protected concerted activity54, and encourages the voluntary recognition of unionization efforts.
   * Allow contract workers to attend All-Hands meetings and be included in other all-staff communication channels where employees are able to receive and respond to company news and important health and safety updates.




























4. Implement equitable procurement practices
As the contracting structure currently stands, it’s remarkably easy for staffing agencies to take an enormous cut of their agreements with tech companies for their own profit. During procurement and in subsequent invoices, staffing agencies often only provide a flat bill rate to the tech company; this enables the agency to charge undisclosed amounts for their agency fee and overhead, while paying the worker less than what the tech company may have intended for the worker to receive.
This lack of transparency hurts the workers and the tech company alike. The contract workers are getting paid a mere fraction of what the company is paying for them, creating a situation of exploitation for the workers, and an opaque financial investment for the company. Tech companies have significant leverage with staffing agencies and can utilize that power to improve the wages, benefits, and working conditions of contract workers—not to mention, improve their return on investment and make wiser long-term financial decisions.
What tech companies can do
   * Require an itemized breakdown within RFPs of agency fees for service (sometimes referred to as “markups”), wage rates, benefits options and employee co-pays, recruiting methods, mentorship opportunities, retention rates, HR protocols, complaint procedures, etc.
   * Require that all vendors and staffing agencies provide detailed assignments to all workers that include pay rate, benefit options and employee contribution, paid time off, HR protocols, complaint procedures, location of assignment, hourly schedule, and agency fees or “markups” for service.
   * Change internal policy to allow for procurement officers to take other factors into account besides cost and competence when making contracting decisions
   * Align RFP review processes to align with best practices for fair chance hiring55 to ensure a more inclusive talent pool; do not work with agencies that implement non-compete practices.


























5. Outline and publish clear pathways to direct employment
Even though contract workers contribute to the success of their tech company, they’re often barred from reaping the benefits of that work. Most tech companies create a firewall between contract roles and full-time opportunities, leaving contract workers on the outside. Given that contract workers are disproportionately from racial and gender groups that are under-represented in tech, this practice creates harm, furthering the racial wealth gap.
By creating real pathways to direct employment, tech companies are not only giving their contract workers a chance at opportunity and security, they’re also opening themselves up to a diverse and experienced talent pool.
What tech companies can do
   * End the gag order on contract workers56 and allow them to list their experience working at the tech company on their resume; stop the practice of penalizing workers (in the form of not extending or renewing their contracts) who do so.
   * Systematize hiring practices that allow contract workers to access internal job boards and acknowledge their previous work and contribution to the company, similar to how internal candidates would be considered with condensed application requirements and shorter review windows.
   * End policies that disincentivize contract worker mobility (non-competes, high fees for conversion) and adopt the incentives provided to direct workers, including hiring bonuses for those who successfully recruit contract workers. Existing policies demonstrate that tech companies understand the rationale behind internal referral systems, offering several-thousand dollar bonuses for successful referral hires57. These policies, replicated for teams or managers who successfully hire former contract workers, would also improve the mobility and stability of tech’s entire workforce.
   * Offer training and professional development opportunities to contract workers. If there are minimum standards for tuition reimbursement provided, do a regular audit of the staffing agencies to ensure those benefits are being distributed and applied correctly.
















6. Improve transparency for workers, companies, shareholders, and the public
Tech companies hold significant influence in the global economy. Their actions—whether in product development, company acquisition, privacy, or labor rights—have ripple effects throughout our society.
By being transparent about their actions, tech companies can ensure that their actions are in-line with their values and their commitments to shareholders, workers, and the public. Sharing the outcomes of these policies helps ensure that tech company’s written policies and stated commitments are correctly applied by the staffing agencies they employ. Tech companies have an opportunity to set an example, to demonstrate what it means to be a responsible actor within the industry and the broader economy. Through establishing transparency and accountability, tech companies can be leaders in ensuring fair treatment for all workers.
What tech companies can do
   * Publish standards for vendors and staffing agencies that includes high-road practices and accountability mechanisms for the vendors and the tech company itself.
   * Publish a list of the vendors and agencies with which they work, as well as aggregate data on workers hired through third parties including racial, gender, and pay demographics in addition to years with the company and classification.
   * Include contract data in annual DEI reports—disaggregating pay, race, gender, and other important equity factors from contractor to direct employee; as well as listing which vendors they are employing.
   * Make reports to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and other relevant state agencies public and easily accessible to workers, shareholders, and the public.
   * Conduct an annual audit of staffing agencies and vendors to ensure that stated commitments and written policies of the tech company are being implemented and applied to the contract workers themselves. When staffing agencies do not comply, ensure that there is a clear policy for those violations that includes dropped contracts, fines, and any other mechanisms that are appropriate to internal policy violation repercussions.


























































































Closing the Gap:
Public Policy


Improving working conditions and ending wage disparities will require policy and regulatory reform. Throughout the Contract Worker Disparity Project, workers have been consistent about what needs to change: equal pay for equal work, greater stability, and better working conditions.




Compensate workers with equal pay for equal work
Workers fulfilling reasonably similar job responsibilities for the same company should earn the same wages, regardless of classification. The federal Equal Pay Act requires that people of different genders, race, and other characteristics must earn equal pay for equal work. The 1963 legislation, as well as many of the efforts to strengthen it at the state level, has adopted new provisions to extend protections to those doing substantially
similar work instead of equal work, yet few have amended the same establishment or same workplace language in a way that would protect contract workers. Amending the federal and state Equal Pay Acts is one way to reign in the significantly different wages that certain workers earn—compared to others working for the same parent company—solely because of who holds their employment agreements.
Ensure safe and secure employment
The fact that many existing labor laws do not acknowledge the unique facets of contract work or adequately protect contract workers is part of the reason the practice is burgeoning, and that working conditions are often so poor. Contract workers must have written information about their job assignments, clear personnel policies and protections, clear contract terms, formal contract extension and cancellation processes, written and accessible pathways to conversion to direct employment, the ability to speak plainly and openly about their work histories, and more.
Federal bills including the Restoring Worker Power Act58 from 2020 outline what a worker-centered temporary worker bill of rights could contain. From receiving little to no written information about their job assignments, contract terms that are frequently in flux and subject to abrupt cancellation, and scant benefits to no meaningful ability to speak up on the job,
contract workers need dedicated and clear worker protections.
Bring transparency to the contract workforce
Measures that create public data and give workers the ability to combat pay disparities are critical. Right now, the relationships between tech companies and contracting agencies are a black box. Even the tech companies don’t know exactly how much some contract workers earn or the specifics of their employment agreements. Traditional workforce reporting processes, including the federal EEO-159 and BLS60 reports, let contracting agencies hide the scale of the problem, by decoupling the workers from their parent companies in ways that prevent contract-worker-to-direct-worker comparisons. To understand the scope and inherent
disparities of limited duration contracts, public agencies must collect granular information on worker earnings, demographics, and company placements disaggregated by worker classification. Requiring that the data come from the parent companies via the contracting agencies would also disrupt the practice that shields companies from the personnel decisions made by contracting agencies and lets corporations deny responsibility for wage and demographic disparities.
Here, the Restoring Worker Power Act again offers one model for how contracting and parent company reporting could look. Locally, recent legislative proposals including California’s 2021 Worker Metrics61 bill also seek to reveal the contours of the contingent workforce.
Across the country, workers are organizing for more transparency and protections in the contingent workforce. TechEquity Collaborative is working with workers, advocates, labor, researchers, and others to advance policy solutions for contract worker justice in California.
Closing the Gap: Worker-Led Solutions


The research and analysis in the Contract Worker Disparity Project are a product of workers’ generosity with their insights and experiences. Current and former contract workers are the experts on this issue, and will be the best shepherds of reform.




Contract workers—and directly-employed tech workers—have already taken the helm on a variety of models for improving the industry and these practices from compiling Know Your Rights resources via Temp Worker Justice to the Tech Worker Handbook issued by Ifeoma Ozoma and organizations forming like Alphabet Workers Union and the Temporary Workers of America, to pioneering digital models focused on worker- centered campaigns at Coworker.Org.
No matter the model it will be up to the workers themselves to decide what pathways they want to take. We hope that our research, recommendations for responsible contracting and public policy solutions, and our education of tech workers can provide another set of tools for contract workers and tech companies who want to end these harmful practices and ensure that everyone working in tech experiences a sustainable, healthy, equitable workplace.",10326,"['despite', 'worldwide', 'pandemic',

Cloudwork (Online Work) Principles,Fairwork,https://fair.work/en/fw/principles/cloudwork-principles/,Principles,NGO/non profit (other),Platform workers generally,Global,06-01-2024,fairwork.txt,"﻿Principle 1: Fair Pay
1.1 - Workers are paid on time and for all completed work (one point)
Workers must have full confidence that they will be paid for the work they do. Workers can sometimes face the risk of a client not paying for work that has been completed. To achieve this point platforms must guarantee that this is not possible. Where a client considers that work is not completed satisfactorily, there must be a clear and reasonable process for rejection decisions. Additionally, timeliness and regularity of payment are crucial to evidencing fair pay.
The platform must satisfy all of the following:
* Non-payment is not an option for clients and there are mechanisms to ensure workers are paid.[1]
* Payments are made within an agreed timeframe.
* Workers can choose to be paid in a recognised national currency.
* Workers can request funds from their account on a regular basis with reasonable withdrawal thresholds.
1.2 - Workers are paid at least the local minimum wage (one additional point)
The rate of pay after costs (like platform fees) must meet the minimum legal threshold in the place where the worker works, regardless of whether the worker earns an hourly wage, or engages in piece-rate work.
The platform must satisfy either 1) or 2) depending on their payment model:
1. For hourly-paid work, workers earn at least their local minimum wage after costs.
2. For piece-rate work:
   * The vast majority of workers earn at least their local minimum wage after costs, [2] and
   * A reasonable estimate of the time it takes to complete each task is provided to each worker before they accept the work.
 
  

Principle 2: Fair Conditions
2.1 - Precarity and overwork are mitigated (one point)
Workers may spend a significant amount of their working day applying for jobs, especially if they are competing with a lot of other workers. This can include sending credentials to prospective clients, or developing pitches. This constitutes working time, but it is time that the worker is not being paid for. In order to reduce this unpaid working time, platforms should ensure that jobs are available to workers on the platform, and there is not an unmitigated oversupply of labour.
The platform must satisfy the following: 
* The allocation of work and/or supply of new workers is managed to promote job availability, and reduce unpaid work and overwork.[3]
2.2 - Healthy and safety risks are mitigated (one additional point)
Health and safety risks to workers can include amongst other things exposure to psychologically harmful material, financial scams, and breaches of data privacy and security. To achieve this point the platform must demonstrate policies and processes that minimise risks to workers.
The platform must satisfy all of the following: 
* There are policies to protect workers from risks that arise from the processes of work.
* There are processes for job-related health and safety risks (including psychological risks) to be identified and addressed.
* Risks related to a specific job are flagged to workers before they accept the job (such as indicating that they might be exposed to violent content).
* There are clear reporting channels and documented penalties for clients who jeopardise workers’ health and safety.
* There are adequate and ethical data privacy and security measures applicable to workers, laid out in a documented policy.[4]
  

Principle 3: Fair Contracts
3.1 - Clear terms and conditions are available (one point)
The terms and conditions governing platform work are not always clear and accessible to workers. To achieve this point the platform must demonstrate that workers are able to understand, agree to, and access the conditions of their work, and that they have legal recourse if the platform breaches those conditions.
The platform must satisfy all of the following: 
* The contract is written in clear and comprehensible language that the worker could be expected to understand.
* The contract is available for workers to access at all times.
* Workers are notified of proposed changes in a reasonable timeframe before changes come into effect.
* Changes should not reverse existing accrued benefits and reasonable expectations on which workers have relied.
* The contract does not require workers to waive rights to reasonable legal recourse against the platform.
3.2 - Contracts are consistent with the workers’ terms of engagement on the platform (one additional point)
Platforms mediate the contact and the transaction between workers and clients. Therefore they have a responsibility for oversight of the relationship between workers and clients, and to protect workers’ interests. This also includes a duty of care in ensuring that direct contracts (such as NDAs) raised between clients and workers do not unfairly disadvantage the worker or reduce the worker’s labour market prospects. Additionally, where workers are self-employed, contracts should allow for freedom to choose their own working schedules, and the jobs they accept or refuse on the platform.
The platform must satisfy ALL of the following:
* Clients are encouraged to inform workers about how their work will be used.
* The worker is not subject to non-compete clauses.
Except in cases where the worker is in a standard employment relationship the platform makes clear to workers and clients that:
* Working schedules cannot be imposed upon workers.[5]
* The worker retains the freedom to choose which tasks to accept or refuse.
* When workers choose not to accept tasks, this does not punitively impact their rating or reputation.[6]
Principle 4: Fair Management
4.1 - There is due process for decisions affecting workers (one point)
Platform workers can experience deactivation; being barred from accessing the platform, sometimes without due process, and losing their income. Workers may be subject to other penalties or disciplinary decisions without the ability to contact the platform to challenge or appeal them if they believe they are unfair. To achieve this point, platforms must demonstrate an ability for workers to meaningfully appeal disciplinary actions.
The platform must satisfy all of the following: 
* There is a channel for workers to communicate with a human representative of the platform. This channel is documented in policies that are easily accessible to workers, and communications are responded to within a reasonable timeframe.
* There is documentation of things the worker isn’t allowed to do, and workers receive an explanation for all punitive actions, including reductions in their rating/platform standing, non-payment, work rejections, penalties, account blocks, deactivation and any other disciplinary actions.
* Explanations for punitive actions and work rejections include information on how they can be appealed.
* The process for workers to appeal punitive actions and work rejections is non-arduous, documented in the contract, and available to workers who no longer have access to the platform.
4.2 - There is equity in the management process (one additional point)
The majority of platforms do not actively discriminate against particular groups of workers. However, they may inadvertently exacerbate already existing inequalities through their design and management. To achieve this point, platforms must show that they have policies against discrimination that can occur between different user groups, and that workers are assured that they will not be disadvantaged through management processes.
The platform must satisfy all of the following: 
* There is a policy which guarantees that the platform will not discriminate against persons on the grounds of racial, ethnic, social or minority background, caste, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, language, gender, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, disability, age, geographical location, or any other status.
* There are mechanisms to reduce the risk of clients discriminating against workers on any basis listed above.
* The platform specifies the methods used to manage and allocate work (including when algorithms are used). Substantive changes to methods of managing and allocating work are preceded by a worker consultation.
Principle 5: Fair Representation
5.1 - Workers have access to representation, and freedom of association (one point)
To observe workers’ right to fair representation, platforms must ensure that workers have information about their options for representation in a dispute, as well as ensuring they have access to an independent advocate. Platforms must also guarantee that workers have freedom of association, as enshrined in the constitution of the International Labour Organisation and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
The platform must satisfy all of the following: 
* The platform commits to a dispute resolution process in which workers can access an independent representative freely chosen by them or an unbiased, independent, and accessible dispute resolution system. [7][8]
* Freedom of association is not inhibited and groups of workers are not disadvantaged in any way for communicating their concerns, demands and wishes to management.
5.2 - There is collective governance or bargaining (one additional point)
The ability for workers to organise and collectively express their voice is an important prerequisite for fair working conditions. Workers must be able to assert their demands through a representational body which is free from any influence by platform management. Where such a body does not exist, it is incumbent on platforms to ensure workers’ voices can be represented by encouraging its formation.
The platform must satisfy either 1), 2) or 3):
1. It is democratically governed by workers.
2. It formally engages with an independent collective body of workers, an elected works council or trade union, and has not refused to engage with collective bodies who seek representation and/or bargaining. New workers are advised of the existence of these bodies.
3. If such a body does not exist, or such bodies have not requested recognition by the platform, the platform has engaged in a formal process of dialogue with local and/or international representative bodies of workers to discuss what structures and processes of representation could look like for platform workers.
1. PLATFORM: Here, the term ‘platform’ is used to refer to a ‘cloudwork platform’ (Woodcock and Graham 2020). Cloudwork platforms are one of two broad types of ‘digital labour platforms’. There are two points of note here. First, a ‘digital labour platform’ is a company that uses digital resources to mediate value-creating interactions between consumers and individual service-providing workers, i.e. that digitally mediates transactions of labour. Digital platforms like Airbnb or eBay—where goods are exchanged—are not included within this definition. Second, among digital labour platforms, there are two broad types. In the first—’geographically-tethered’ or ‘location-based’ platforms—the work is required to be done in a particular location (e.g. delivering food from a restaurant to an apartment or driving a person from one part of town to another). In contrast, in the second—’cloudwork’ platforms—the work can, in theory, be performed from anywhere via the internet (e.g. data categorisation or online freelancing). In these principles, the term ‘platform’ refers only to the second category of cloudwork platforms.
2. WORKER: People who find work through platforms, regardless of their employment status (e.g. employees or independent contractors).
3. CONTRACTS: All written agreements between parties about the terms of the work including terms and conditions. These may be signed in-person or electronically.
Footnotes
1. As a guideline for ensuring non-payment is not an option, see  criteria developed by Harmon and Silberman in their 2018 ‘Rating working conditions on digital labour platforms’, as follows:
In cases where rejection mechanisms exist for delivered work:
* Workers should be able to contest rejection decisions.
* Workers receive a clear and reasonable explanation for any rejections
* Workers may attempt to redo rejected work at least once
* If the worker contests the rejection decision, the case is reviewed (a second time) by a neutral third party, who makes a binding decision; the platform agrees not to punish the worker in any way if the third party decides in favor of the worker
* If the work is rejected it is not able to be used by the client. 
2. This can be evidenced either through a policy, or by provision of aggregated earnings data. The ‘vast majority’ of workers is understood as 85% or more of all workers engaged on the platform. This is in recognition of the fact that all the time between when a worker starts and submits a task may not necessarily be working time.We compare worker’s piece-work earnings against minimum wages based on UK government guidelines. The calculation is as follows:Number of tasks of a given kind completed by workers on average per hour = A
* This number is divided by 1.2 to calculate A*, an estimated average number of tasks completed per hour that accounts for the disadvantage that relatively inexperienced workers face.
* Therefore, A* = 0.83A
Local minimum hourly wage = M,
* This figure varies across jurisdictions.
* Where a jurisdiction’s laws do not specify a minimum wage, a reasonable alternative can be used.
Fair piece rate corresponding to the minimum wage = F = (M ÷ 0.83A).
This calculation must be repeated across task types. To receive this point, platforms operating on a piece-work model must demonstrate that 85% or more of workers on their platform earn more than F per hour in each task type.
3. This could include regular guaranteed hours, managed supply and demand, or minimum and maximum hours.
4. To fulfil this criterion, platforms must have clear policies about what kind of data is collected from workers, when it is collected, how long it is kept, and how it is processed. They must take responsibility of data handling, storing and management processes, and ensure that personal data is kept safe and secure and is not sold or shared with third parties, without workers’ specific consent.
5. The platform shall encourage clients to adopt working time arrangements that are consistent with the contractual terms of the worker-client relationship. While workers may be required to meet project deadlines or to attend meetings, in the absence of an employment relationship, the platform shall discourage clients from unreasonably interfering with a worker’s ability to choose their own working time schedule.
6. When a worker drops out from an ongoing job, this does not punitively impact their rating or reputation if it is for a reasonable cause, or if the worker leaves the job before it started and if the requester has been given sufficient notice.  Platforms might choose to categorise, filter and order inactive profiles without directly changing their reputation score or rating on the platform.
7. The platform publicly commits to support any effort by its workers to collectively organise or form a trade union. This could be done by, for instance, adding the following text in their contracts: “[company] will support any effort by its workers to collectively organise or form a trade union. Collective bargaining through trade unions can often bring about more favourable working conditions”. Platforms are also required to provide a directory of international labour unions and confederations and advocates to workers on request.
8. An example is the German Trade Union IG Metall’s Ombuds Office, which arbitrates disputes between workers and platforms that have signed up to the Crowdsourcing Code of Conduct",2485,"['principle',

Sourcing
Guidelines
The choices made by AI practitioners have an
important influence on the working conditions
of data enrichment professionals who perform
tasks such as data annotation, data cleaning,
and human review of algorithmic outputs.
This document lists five key, worker-centric
guidelines that AI practitioners should follow
when setting up a project involving data
enrichment. They are based on the input
from a multi-stakeholder community of data
enrichment companies, labor organizers,
AI practitioners, and leading researchers in
the space.
To learn more about how this resource
was developed, visit PAI’s responsible data
enrichment sourcing library.
Ensure all data enrichment
1 2
workers are paid above the
local living wage
AI Practitioners must pay workers/participants at
least the living wage for their location. Therefore,
please take into consideration the following when
setting payment terms: the worker’s location,
estimated time needed to complete a task and other
associated activities, payment structure (e.g. per
task, per hour, etc), and the difficulty of the task.
For more information on Global Living Wage,
please see Annex 1 of PAI’s white paper. These are
calculated at a country-level basis; if more exact
locations are provided (e.g. State/City), please use the
corresponding living wage for that location, as these
may differ to the national standard.
If the data enrichment project pays per task, use
the pilots (see Guideline 2) to establish a baseline
estimate of how long it takes to complete a task,
including time spent reading instructions, going
through any training and reviewing work before
submission. The per task rate should be based
on the hourly living wage, divided by the adjusted
number of tasks that can be completed in an hour.
Furthermore, researchers should track completion
times throughout the data enrichment project and
adjust targets, and compensation, accordingly.
AI Practitioners should pay for any work completed
by workers to compensate for their time, being
mindful that mass rejections of work completed
without opportunities for redress impact the
workers’ livelihood. The only exceptions should be
in the cases of obvious abuse or fraud.
Design and run a pilot
before launching a data
enrichment project
AI Practitioners should always run a pilot before
launching a new or substantially modified data
enrichment project; this helps establish reasonable
baselines for timeframes and payments. Pilots are
smaller versions of data enrichment projects done
before the main project with the goal of testing
the project design so AI practitioners can make
adjustments before the full data enrichment project
is done under the same conditions. Pilots should also
be used to test the clarity of the instructions and
gather feedback on worker experience, looking at task
design and tool usability. Testing should occur with
a representative group of workers/participants to
ensure that researchers get feedback from the types
of people who will be completing the task later.
Note: Pilots can recruit a distinct set of workers compared
with the main data enrichment project. However, using
the same filters as you would for the actual task is helpful
for recruiting similar workers for both.3
Identify appropriate data
enrichment workers for the
desired task
Matching data enrichment tasks to the skill set,
expertise, and/or demographic category of workers
can ensure your data enrichment project keeps
to time, whilst also protecting workers against
the economic impacts of wasted time or rejected
tasks. Depending on the data enrichment project, AI
practitioners may need to identify a demographically
representative set of workers or identify workers with
the relevant demographic background necessary
to complete the task (e.g. cultural background, age
range, location). AI Practitioners should be mindful
when designing eligibility criteria, assuring the
requirements for successful task completion are
clear and only relevant to the task (e.g. language
proficiency or domain knowledge) and not onerous,
overly limiting or potentially identifying.
For more complex tasks, or those that require
a certain level of domain knowledge, it may be
beneficial to maintain a consistent workforce
across the project lifetime; in this case, both data
quality and worker satisfaction can be improved
by investing in a workforce. In other instances
a consistent workforce may not be appropriate;
for example if data collection would benefit from
diversity or broader coverage of individuals.
Provide verified instructions
4 5
and/or training materials
for data enrichment workers
Create clear training materials for data enrichment
tasks, taking into account the existing and required
domain knowledge of workers, as well as the tools
or platforms being used. Instructions should
undergo review by a representative group of workers
during an official pilot, before becoming verified.
Instructions should typically include examples of
correctly and incorrectly completed tasks and, for
more difficult studies, allow workers a few practice
tasks before launching a new data enrichment
project. Please refer to this checklist to help guide
you in what to include as a part of your instructions
and training materials.
Note: As discussed in 1, time spent reading instructions
or in training should be compensated.
Establish clear and
regular communication
mechanisms
Clear communication is critical to ensuring workers
have the necessary information to effectively and
efficiently complete tasks. AI Practitioners should
clarify expectations around communication
cadence with workers or managers before starting
the project and ensure that workers know who and
how to raise questions or concerns with, including
contesting any rejected work.
Irrespective of whether your data enrichment
project involves one off interactions with workers
or reengagement with the same pool over time, AI
Practitioners must ensure that workers are provided
with clear mechanisms for asking questions,
reporting concerns or technical issues that may
arise during the data enrichment project. Moreover,
AI Practitioners should collect feedback from
workers on all aspects of the project and adjust the
data enrichment project accordingly.",942,"['data', 'enrichment', 'sourcing', 'guideline', 'choice', 'made', 'ai', 'practitioner', 'important', 'influence', 'working', 'condition', 'data',

Protocols for Safe Content Moderation,UNI Global,https://uniglobalunion.org/wp-content/uploads/The-People-Behind-the-Screens-FINAL.pdf,Protocols,Union (or federation),Content moderators,Global,06-01-2025,uni.txt,"﻿Over 80% of content moderators said their employer
needs to do more to support their mental health (80.7%).
UNI Global Union survey
over forty workers across six countries to develop
comprehensive guidelines for making this critical
work more sustainable. This is the first study of its
kind – and the findings are alarming. Our findings
expose a hidden workforce enduring precarious
contracts, low wages and psychological distress.
We also draw from the research of Equidem to
highlight the systemic failures of platform compa-
nies in protecting the mental health and labour
rights of content moderators.1
The content moderation industry is structured
to distance major tech firms – such as Alphabet,
Amazon, ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft – from
direct responsibility. These companies outsource
moderation to Business Process Outsourcing
(BPO) firms like Accenture, Concentrix and Telus
Digital and Teleperformance which concentrate
jobs in lower-wage countries and regions around
the world.
Every second, vast amounts of user-generated
content floods digital platforms worldwide. Among
this content is material that is violent, disturbing
or otherwise harmful, and it must be identified
and removed to maintain safe, accessible online
spaces. We take for granted that we can browse
the internet freely, finding what we need without
being bombarded by graphic violence, hate
speech or explicit content. But without content
moderators, the internet would be like a city
without law and order – where every street is filled
with chaos, danger, scams and disturbing imagery,
making it impossible to navigate safely or find what
you’re looking for. Content moderators are the
invisible frontline workers who shield us from this
digital chaos, yet they do so under conditions that
expose them to severe psychological harm. Unlike
emergency responders and other trauma-exposed
professionals, they frequently lack even the most
basic workplace protections necessary to safe-
guard their health and wellbeing.
UNI Global Union and our affiliates have long
engaged with content moderators over their
working conditions, but for the first time, we have
conducted a systematic, global effort to document
their experiences. We surveyed 206 moderators
worldwide and conducted in-depth interviews with
They tell us to increase speed and
they punish us for not meeting the
quality standard, which changes every
month - and they always take away our
bonuses.
Content moderator, Colombia
Automation is frequently cited as the future of
content moderation, yet AI remains deeply reliant
on human labour. Moderators train AI systems,
review their errors and must identify the most
disturbing content – often under increased strain
from algorithmic management systems. Rather
than replacing human oversight, AI exacerbates
the burden on workers, making robust labour
protections more critical than ever.
To address these urgent issues, UNI Global Union,
our affiliates and workers through the Global Trade
Union Alliance for Content Moderators have devel-
oped eight protocols for safe content moderation
that establish essential safeguards for moderators.
We are calling on tech companies to implement
these practices across their supply chains. These
include:
1. Exposure limits: Strict time limits on moderating harmful content; use of blurring, grayscale
and excerpts to minimize exposure. Mirror best
practices in emergency response professions.
2. Revised productivity metrics: Eliminate unrealistic quotas and ensure human oversight in
performance evaluations. Remove productivity
targets for moderating egregious content.
3. Comprehensive and transparent health and
safety training: Mandatory and re-occurring,
trauma-informed training for moderators and
their supervisors.
4. 5. 6. 7. 8. Employee assistance and long-term support:
24/7 employee assistance access; counselling;
critical incident reporting; and trauma-informed
resources. Post-contract support for at least 24
months to address delayed-onset trauma.
Stable employment and living wages: Formalized employment with permanent contracts,
living wages and full employment benefits.
Joint occupational health and safety com-
mittees: Democratically elected committees
to enforce workplace protections and perform
regular audits with transparent health and
safety assessments.
Migrant worker protections: Policies that pre-
vent exploitation, provide job security, protect
against labour abuses and support vulnerable
workers.
Right to organize a union and collective
bargaining: Respect for the right to organize
without interference or opposition from the
employer, alongside a policy to allow access
to the union. Collective bargaining with recognized unions.

CONTENT MODERATION:
THE HIDDEN WORKFORCE KEEPING
THE INTERNET SAFE
Content moderators play a vital role in ensuring
safe and accessible digital spaces for billions of
users on platforms like Facebook, TikTok and
YouTube. Every second, internet platforms gener-
ate massive amounts of user content – some of it
harmful, illegal or in violation of platform policies.
Content moderators are the invisible frontline,
sifting through this material to keep online spaces
safe. They remove hate speech, misinformation
and graphic content, ensuring compliance with
both legal and community standards. This work de-
mands constant judgement, emotional resilience
and cultural sensitivity, all performed under intense
time pressure and strict performance targets.
like debriefing sessions, stress management
training and access to mental health care. Content
moderators, however, are left to cope alone, with
insufficient occupational safety and health (OSH)
training or psychological support, despite perform-
ing emotionally intensive labour under constant
surveillance and time pressure.
In speaking to moderators from across the world,
we found that most tend to be hired with low pay
and minimal rights. Where workers move coun-
tries, employers sometimes house employees in
company-chosen accommodations that workers
pay for. Many depend on their employer for work
There is an exclusive Facebook messaging line that handles everything related
to inappropriate interactions with children, and it is extremely intense.
Content moderator, Colombia
To meet this global demand for content mod-
eration, companies rely on a hidden workforce,
including many migrant workers who bring
essential language skills, cultural knowledge and
digital expertise. Digital platforms require culturally
specific moderation services for every corner of
the world, and these workers are often recruited
from neighbouring countries to fill the need.
Despite being exposed to egregious content daily,
including violence, exploitation and abuse, many
content moderators work without the basic protections given to other trauma-exposed professionals.
First responders and emergency dispatchers,
for example, benefit from laws that address psy-
chosocial hazards, as well as structured support
permits, that in some cases leave them unable to
access public services and protections. These con-
ditions, combined with legal and structural barriers,
make it extremely difficult for content moderators
to organize collectively or join unions, especially in
jurisdictions where migrant worker protections are
weak.
A more responsible approach is needed, one
that values the expertise of content moderators,
provides fair wages, ensures job security and
upholds fundamental rights. By recognizing the
contributions of this workforce and implementing
strong labour protections, the industry can create
a safer working environment for those who protect
our digital space.
THE BUSINESS OF CONTENT
MODERATION: OUTSOURCING
ACCOUNTABILITY
Content moderation is a vital operation that keeps
digital platforms usable, but instead of handling it
in-house, major tech companies typically offload
the work to third-party firms – Business Process
Outsourcing companies (BPOs). This creates a
complex, layered system where global platforms
delegate content moderation to outsourcing firms,
distancing themselves from direct accountability.
The biggest players requiring content moderation
include:
• Alphabet (YouTube, Google Search Engine,
Maps)
• Amazon (Twitch, Amazon.com)
• ByteDance (TikTok)
• Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp)
• Microsoft (LinkedIn, Xbox Live, other
platforms)
• X (formerly Twitter)
While BPOs may hold the contracts, the core
aspects of content moderation – such as training
protocols, review policies, moderation tools and
performance metrics – are largely determined by
the tech companies themselves. This arrangement
allows platforms to maintain operational control
while distancing themselves from direct respon-
sibility for working conditions. In several cases,
when workers have raised concerns or attempted
to organize, the response has included threats to
shift contracts to other jurisdictions, limiting their
ability to advocate for improved standards
SECTION 3
FOUR KEY CHALLENGES FACED
BY CONTENT MODERATORS
1. EGREGIOUS CONTENT AND
VICARIOUS TRAUMA
The prolonged exposure to graphic, violent and
hateful material has been associated with significant mental health impacts for many content
moderators, including symptoms of post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression and, in
extreme cases, suicidality. Despite the well-documented psychological risks inherent in this work,2
access to employer-provided mental health sup-
port is often limited or inconsistent, leaving many
workers without adequate resources to manage
the toll of their responsibilities.
I’ve watched thousands of videos
and many types of content. Because
of some of them, I have become
numb, because of some of them,
I have become more profane,
and because of some of them,
I have nightmares. This job left
permanent trauma in my brain.
Content moderator, Türkiye
Content moderation involves more than reviewing
individual posts – it requires confronting some of
the most disturbing aspects of human behavior
on a daily basis. Moderators interviewed by UNI
Global Union described training practices that,
rather than mitigating harm, sometimes exacerbated psychological distress. In certain companies,
Will AI replace content moderation?
Automation in content moderation has significant
limitations. Despite advances in AI, human content
moderators remain essential – and will continue to
be – for several key reasons. AI is not autonomous.
It depends on human labour at every stage –
workers train the models, refine outputs and
intervene when automation fails. Human-labelled
data is the foundation of every algorithm, and
behind the scenes, moderators still make critical
decisions about harmful or borderline content.
AI struggles with context, sarcasm, cultural nuances and emerging trends in harmful content. Even
the most sophisticated models make mistakes,
requiring human review to prevent the spread of
egregious material. Tech companies recognize this
fact and so they continue to rely on thousands of
human moderators to ensure platform safety.
Moreover, the integration of AI does not eliminate
moderation jobs – it transforms them. Instead of
removing human oversight, AI often increases the
cognitive burden on workers, who must specifically
label content and deal with more complex cases AI
cannot process. Far from replacing moderators,
as discussed in this report, AI risks intensifying
their workload, making workplace protections
even more critical.
The hidden labour behind AI remains largely
unrecognized in mainstream discussions, which
tend to focus on technological breakthroughs
rather than the human workers making them
happen. Without content moderators, AI systems
would not function effectively. As long as digital
platforms exist, there will be a need for human
judgement, ethical oversight and safeguards that
only workers - not algorithms - can provide.
The workload is not the same between all the workers, and some of us get to
do three or four times more content than others. For example, I usually work the
evening shift and there is a lot more content to moderate but less moderators
working, while on the morning shift there are a lot of moderators but less content.
When I try to call attention to this problem, I’m being told that this is why they
have the good workers in the evening and that we can handle it.
Content moderator, Portugal
errors in content decisions triggered a requirement
to rewatch the same disturbing material multiple
times until the correct judgement was made. This
approach, intended as a learning tool, instead
risked compounding trauma and creating harmful
patterns of repeated exposure.
Another moderator reported that one team leader
assigned all sexually explicit content to a single
worker, believing they were the most skilled at this
type of moderation. As a result, the worker was
subjected to nonstop exposure to graphic material,
with no rotation or reprieve – intensifying the
psychological burden and removing any opportunity for relief or recovery.
One moderator described the slow erosion of their
humanity:
“We become numb. There is no difference
between watching someone eat and watching
someone slice open their own arms – because
after a while, neither triggers any reaction in us…
Beheadings, child abuse, people making love
– how many times can you watch these things
before you stop feeling anything at all? How
many masturbation videos can you sit through
before you’re sick to your stomach? How many
slurs against women and children can you hear
before they stop registering? We watch. We
listen. We see. It’s our job. But we lose our ability
to be human. We lose our emotions. We can’t be
happy. We can’t be sad. We become robots.”
Content moderator, Türkiye.
Some platforms have introduced the blurring of
egregious content to protect workers from the
psychological effects of harmful material. However,
workers said they had to remove the blurring
tool when labelling images as they are unable
to specifically see the material in the necessary
detail, meaning their performance measures
dropped. The pressure to meet the performance
targets meant that the blurring tools are frequently
not used by the workers we spoke to. Workers
believe they are training AI algorithms to moderate
content, meaning that the labelling of images must
be extremely precise and comply with extensive
client policies. We did not speak to workers who
had been told by their employers the purpose of
the data labelling.
8BPO workers in the Philippines demand the right to organize.
Two content moderators we spoke to said the
moderation platform they used had an option to
switch off egregious content, allowing them to
avoid harmful content from time to time. However,
this often meant that they received little or no
tasks. As a result, they were considered inactive
and received no pay for that period.
2. MANAGED BY MACHINES:
THE RELENTLESS PACE OF
CONTENT MODERATION
Content moderators don’t just work – they race
against the clock. Their performance is measured
by rigid key performance indicators (KPIs) and
often managed by algorithms that demand nearly
impossible levels of speed and accuracy. One
moderator described the relentless pace:
“In just one year, our daily video targets more
than doubled. We have to watch videos running
at double or triple speed, just to keep up. There’s
no time to think. No time to process. The only
way to hit the numbers is to skip toilet breaks,
meals and rest.”
Content Moderator, Tunisia
In one site, we heard from moderators who are
required to monitor two content streams simultaneously, processing multiple videos at once. Many
reported watching videos at double or triple speed,
with no breaks between them for hours on end.
The pressure to meet ever-increasing targets
forces some to work beyond their scheduled hours,
sacrificing rest and well-being just to keep up.
One concerning trend that emerged in our inter-
views is the heavy reliance on performance-based
pay. Many moderators reported that up to 50 per
cent of their total compensation came from productivity bonuses. These bonuses are not optional
perks, they are essential to earning a livable
income. This model creates a powerful incentive to
prioritize output over personal health and well-be-
ing. In practice, it pushes workers to process large
volumes of egregious content rapidly, heightening
both the risk of burnout and exposure to trauma.
3. LACK OF TRAINING
AND SUPPORT
Content moderators are thrown into highly trau-
matic work often with insufficient health and safety training,3 leaving them unprepared for the emotional toll of their jobs. Many describe being given
only a basic orientation before being expected to
handle distressing content – such as violent acts,
exploitation and hate speech – on a daily basis.
While some companies provide access to psycho-
therapists, these professionals are often limited to
crisis intervention and triage rather than comprehensive care.4 One moderator shared,
“We can book a session, but the therapist is only
there to assess if we’re still fit to work. It’s not real
support.”
To address this, companies must ensure access to
licensed, independent mental health professionals
who are specifically trained in trauma and crisis
response. These therapists must operate outside
the management structure to build trust and
ensure confidentiality, so that moderators can seek
help without risking their jobs or careers.

Employing a total of 450,000 workers around the
world, California-based Concentrix is one of the
largest business service companies in the world,
which also provides content moderation services
for tech clients. While Concentrix does not explicitly list unionization as a risk to its business like
Telus Digital, it does admit that “except for a small
number of our employees in certain countries,
generally required by local regulations or brought
in through acquisitions, our employees are not rep-
resented by a labour union, nor are they covered
by a collective bargaining agreement”.8
4. BARRIERS TO UNIONIZATION
Wages are extremely low and the
company fires content moderators
if they want to unionize,
Content moderator, Türkiye
The right to organize in a trade union is recognized as a human right, and the freedom to join
a union and collectively bargain is one of the five
fundamental principles and rights upheld by the
International Labour Organization (ILO). The ability
to organize is considered an “enabling right”
because it allows workers to collectively defend
and advance their other rights through being in a
union. If content moderators were able to orga-
nize, they could ensure their work is done safely
and improve their working conditions.
Canadian company Telus Digital provides ser-
vices for Google, Meta and TikTok, and identifies
employees unionizing as a risk to the business in
its annual report.5 In Türkiye, when Telus Digital
content moderators attempted to organize they
were dismissed according to media reports,6
while in Germany a union member who spoke to
Teleperformance, which employs 490,000 workers
around the world, is a major provider of content
moderation services and has taken a different ap-
proach to Telus Digital and Concentrix. Teleperfor-
mance signed a global agreement with UNI Global
Union at the end of 2022.9 In the agreement, the
parties commit to working together to uphold
labour rights, including freedom of association and
collective bargaining, and ensure a non-opposi-tional environment for workers to exercise their
right to organize. As a result, Teleperformance
content moderators in Colombia have organized
and secured a collective agreement, while moderators in Portugal and Kenya are in the process of
implementing the agreement and organizing with
national unions in their countries.
CASE STUDY: HOW OTHER
TRAUMA-EXPOSED PROFESSIONS
PROTECT WORKERS
While content moderators endure graphic and
distressing material daily, they lack the workplace
protections afforded to other trauma-exposed
professions. Here’s how different sectors address
psychological hazards:
Profession & location Protections
First responders (paramedics and police services) Canada
Mandatory psychological debriefing after critical incidents, peer support programmes and access to
long-term mental health care. There are many mental training programmes available to personnel,
including critical incident stress management (CISM), critical incident stress debriefing (CISD), peer
support, mental health first aid and Road to Mental Readiness (R2MR). These exist to minimize the
impact of stressors on personnel.
Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (CISD): After exposure to a traumatic incident, workers are
debriefed within 24-72 hours with trained counsellors and/or peer support groups.
Regular mental health screenings: Many departments offer regular psychological evaluations,
covered by employer insurance.
Workload caps and rotations: To prevent chronic exposure, some departments rotate staff out of
high-trauma assignments (e.g., homicide or child abuse units) after a set time.

Stress management training, rotational shifts to prevent burnout and counselling services covered

Post-traumatic call procedures: After handling traumatic calls, dispatchers may participate in
critical incident stress debriefing (CISD) sessions. CISD is a structured process aimed at mitigating
stress and promoting recovery by allowing emergency personnel to discuss their experiences and
emotions in a supportive environment. There are no productivity targets for dispatchers who have
returned to work after a critical incident.

SECTION 4
EIGHT PROTOCOLS FOR SUSTAINABLE
CONTENT MODERATION
Using our survey data and interviews capturing
input from hundreds of content moderators
along with our research into protections of other
trauma-exposed workforces, we have developed
eight concrete protocols for sustainable content
moderation.
1. Limit exposure to egregious content
Workers’ exposure to egregious content should be
limited to one hour per day, five hours maximum
per week – pairing this cap with regular task
rotation to less graphic or demanding roles. To
minimize harm, content should be blurred, shown
in grayscale, or presented as excerpts rather than
full clips. This mirrors best practices in emergency
response professions, which limit exposure to
traumatic incidents to prevent burnout, PTSD, suicidality and suicide. If a moderator finds a specific
queue traumatic or triggering, they should be able
to request reassignment to a different queue with-
out facing any penalties or repercussions.10 Long-
term exposure to less extreme, but still disturbing
content, can have a cumulative impact, especially
if no limits are placed on working hours.
Over 70% of respondents moderate
“sexually explicit or violent content”
UNI Global Union survey
2. Revise productivity metrics with human
oversight
Tech companies must replace rigid, automated KPI
systems with human-led performance evaluations
that account for the mental health and well-being
of content moderators. Productivity expectations
should be realistic and adjusted based on the
10 Note: workers have a right to refuse without fear of ‘undue
consequences’ (ILO C155, Article 13) if they believe their
work presents a ‘serious and imminent’ risk to their ‘life or
health’ (ILO C155, Article 19(f)).
complexity of the content being reviewed – with
no quotas for moderating egregious content,
eliminating KPIs that encourage workers not to
use blurring tools. Workers must have the right to
challenge algorithmic decisions about promotions,
pay and termination, with a fair appeals process
and representation. Productivity targets must be
transparent and communicated to workers during
hiring so that they are informed of the service lev-
els and can make informed decisions. No worker
should have to skip breaks to meet quotas – safe
staffing levels must be enforced. Companies must
also redefine “working time” to include basic
human needs, so moderators are not penalized for
reasons such as bathroom breaks or rest periods.
3. Comprehensive health and safety training for
moderators and managers
Research demonstrates a clear connection
between health and safety training and positive
outcomes for workers. Employers must ensure
full transparency during recruitment, providing
detailed information about the role to enable
moderators to make informed decisions and
implement harm-reduction practices from the start.
Job descriptions should explicitly state that the
role involves moderating sensitive, explicit and
potentially harmful content, with generic examples
provided during interviews.
Before engaging with sensitive content, mod-
erators must complete mandatory training
during work time, including culturally sensitive,
trauma-informed, psychological health and safety
training, repeated annually and incorporated into
paid work hours. Training should cover wellness
programmes, psychological coping strategies and
procedures for requesting alternative work placements. Employers must collect a signed acknowledgment confirming that moderators understand
available resources and policies.
Managers and supervisors must complete manda-
tory trauma-informed training within two weeks of
13onboarding, focusing on supporting moderators’
well-being and managing employees in distress,
with paid annual refresher courses.
Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) are frequently
introduced during initial training sessions and
often function to silence workers and discourage
them from raising concerns about their working
conditions. This practice creates a chilling effect
that undermines transparency and accountability.
While NDAs may be used to protect proprietary
information or client content, they must not extend
to issues related to occupational safety, mental
health or general working conditions. Companies
must ensure that NDAs do not interfere with a
moderator’s ability to report harmful practices,
organize for safer conditions, or seek support.
When respondents reported having been
adequately trained, complaints about mental
health issues were cut in half.
UNI Global Union survey
job security or retaliation. Companies should fund
independent therapists who operate through or
are co-managed by the union, ensuring confidentiality and psychological safety.
Wellness resources, including EAP access, must
continue for at least 24 months post-contract,
ensuring long-term psychological support for
delayed-onset trauma.
5. Guarantee long-term, stable employment
contracts and living wages
Content moderators’ employment contracts should
have full-time, permanent positions with benefits
such as health insurance, paid time off, paid sick
leave and career development opportunities.
Providing long-term, stable employment is essential to valuing both the job and the people who do
it. Like other professions where trauma is inherent,
content moderation is a profession and must be
recognized as such. Furthermore, implementing
living wages is crucial to ensuring that content
moderators are not only fairly compensated for the
emotional and psychological toll of their work but
also able to support themselves and their families
with dignity. Exactly how much performance
bonuses represent relative to base pay depends
on the country, but our study found examples
where half of the moderator pay is linked to performance-based bonuses tied to speed and output.
Through making these bonuses essential, workers
are pressured to push through traumatic content
to earn a dignified wage.
Workers should be clearly informed during their
training sessions that NDAs do not apply to discus-
sions about their well-being, workplace treatment
or union rights.
4. Employee Assistance Programmes and long-
term support
Companies must provide comprehensive Employee Assistance Programmes (EAPs) with 24/7
support, counselling, family assistance and critical
incident response. Licensed, independent therapists with expertise in vicarious trauma must be
available during paid work hours. Workers should
have a clear, accessible pathway to report mental
health concerns without fear of job loss or discrim-
ination, while protecting worker confidentiality.
Peer support groups should meet at least monthly
with employer-provided resources. Individual and
group counselling must be available, providing
moderators with at least 45-minute individual ses-
sions available per month. A crisis-trained licensed
therapist must be available whenever moderators
work.
To build trust, therapists must not only be professionally qualified but also demonstrably indepen-
dent of the employer. Many workers fear disclosing
mental health struggles due to concerns about
146. Democratically elected and trained occupational health and safety committees
Joint occupational health and safety (OSH)
committees, where workers elect their own rep-
resentatives, are essential to identify risk, prevent
harm and effectively implement health and safety
programmes. Their importance is reinforced by in-
ternational labour standards: ILO Recommendation
164 affirms workers’ rights to safety representation
and equal participation, while ILO Convention 155
highlights the need for robust occupational health
and safety frameworks for all workers.
Protecting content moderators requires more than
one-time interventions – it demands sustained
efforts such as periodic audits, collecting worker
feedback and tracking health outcomes. Trade
unions and OSH committees are central to these
processes and ensure that worker perspectives
are reflected in both the design, oversight and
continuous improvement of safety measures.
7. Protect migrant workers
Migrant workers are a crucial part of the content
moderation workforce, yet they face unique
vulnerabilities.11 Tech companies must ensure
that BPOs provide migrant moderators with fair
and secure working conditions, including offering
employment contracts in the worker’s native
language so that workers fully understand their
rights, responsibilities and terms of employment.
Additionally, employer-funded legal assistance for
visa and work permit applications is essential for
compliance with local labour laws. Where relevant,
work contracts should not tie legal residency or
work permits exclusively to the employer, prevent-
ing situations of forced dependency.
Employers should provide safe, dignified and
independent housing options, rather than compa-
ny-controlled accommodations that restrict move-
ment and autonomy. Companies should support
migrant workers to choose their own accommoda-
tion, where the rental agreement is independent of
their employer.
Migrant workers must have the freedom to join
unions without fear of retaliation linked to their visa
status. Employers must inform workers in writing
of their right to join a union, and this step is even
more important for migrant employees who have
greater vulnerability than those who are contract-
ed in their home country.
Access to professional mental health and community support is also crucial, with regular individual
and group sessions facilitated by trained and
certified mental health professionals to address
the unique stressors facing migrant workers.
Employers should conduct wellness checks if a
migrant worker is absent from work and notify
the relevant authorities if they do not respond.
Furthermore, BPOs should support new workers in
building social and professional networks, helping
them integrate into their workplaces and local
communities.
8. Respect the right to organize a union and
collective bargaining
Freedom of association is crucial for the protection
and empowerment of content moderators and
other tech workers worldwide. By joining a union,
workers collectively empower themselves to en-
sure their rights are upheld, their voices are heard
and their well-being is prioritized now and into
the future. BPOs should recognize unions without
interference or opposition, participate in collective
bargaining, and engage in transparent and con-
structive dialogue to address workers’ concerns.
This engagement is foundational to create safer
work and it contributes to the long-term success
of the industry by promoting ethical practices and
improving employee well-being and retention.

CONCLUSION:
A CALL TO ACTION
Many content moderators take deep pride in
their work – protecting children, shielding fellow
citizens from harm, and upholding the integrity
of digital public spaces. Like first responders,
they perform difficult and often invisible work for
the public good. They deserve the same dignity,
recognition and protection we afford to others
doing society’s most vital jobs.
AI can support moderation, but it cannot replace
human judgement. Only people can navigate the
cultural, linguistic, and ethical complexities needed
to assess harm and context.
For the first time, tech firms and the BPOs in their
supply chains have clear, evidence-based guid-
ance on how to achieve this: by adopting the Eight
Protocols for Sustainable Content Moderation.
At the center of these protocols are freedom of
association and collective bargaining – tools that
empower workers to shape the conditions under
which they labour.
If there is no action, then we – as users of these
platforms – must raise our collective voices to
stand with the people who shield us from the
unimaginable. It’s time to stand with the people
behind the screens.",5146,"['80', 'content', 'moderator', 'said', 'employer', 'need', 'support', 'mental', 'health', '807', 'uni', 'global', 'union', 'survey', 'forty', 'worker', 'across', 'six',

Building Better Workplaces for Data Workers,Aapti Institute; Karya,datawork.aapti.in,Standards,NGO/non profit (other),Data workers,India,,aapti.txt,"﻿Stage 01
The first stage serves as a checklist and roadmap for addressing documented precarities surrounding data workers.
The standards make recommendations on how data workers’ contracts are arranged, workers’ freedom to pursue aid
and redressal as per regulations, their ability to earn, the design of their working environments, required safety
measures, and termination processes. Compliance with local regulations and this first stage of standards will create
basic safety and stability for workers involved in data generation and enrichment.
Decent contracts
Contracts’ designs can create risks and strain for workers. These problems arise from contractual practices like short
contract durations, excessive non-disclosure measures, and inadequate information on topics like workflows, the
downstream use of datasets, and the potential hazards for workers. Companies can design and administer contracts
that inform workers about their roles, avoid potentially harmful constraints, and provide paid work for substantial
periods of time.
Easy to understand
Contract contents should be written in a way that most people can understand and should be available in languages
workers are proficient in.
Minimum contract duration
Companies' worker contracts cannot have engagement periods of less than three months.
Clear information in the contract
Workers' contracts should include key information about key topics like compensation calculation, the role’s
requirements and processes, the metrics and information collected about them, the hazards and risks involved, and
all policies related to termination, promotion, and social support and benefits.
Auxiliary standard: Companies managing data workers need to minimize vagueness and open-endedness
surrounding worker’s roles, the workflows, and company expectations. As workers are introduced to new work and
roles, they should be provided clear, updated contracts that explain the changes being made to their work.
Guaranteed freedoms
Governments provide requirements, entitlements and guidance that help define acceptable working conditions and
labor well-being. Data workers can face resistance when they attempt to raise organizational issues or collectivise.
Workers should not face impediments, intimidation or retaliation for availing any redressal or rights available to them.
Wherever possible, companies should follow local regulations and respect workers’ rights.
Non-interference in rights and regulations
Workers' contracts should not ask or require workers to waive any of their labor rights, contract terms, or any other
provisions and remedies available to them under local laws and regulations.
Freedom to raise issues
Companies should not, through contracts, business confidentiality measures, or any other means, stop and silence
workers from raising issues and sharing information on any challenges or risks they face in their work.
For example, workers cannot be prevented from discussing their distress or problems freely with their families,
doctors, lawyers, or mental health practitioners.
No penalisation for raising issues
No worker should be penalized, removed from work, or refused a contract renewal for raising issues with the
company, management, or among one's fellow workers.
No retaliation for seeking recourse from outside the firm
No workers should be removed from work, refused a contract renewal, stopped, intimidated, coerced, prohibited, or
penalized for pursuing legal remedies of any form, for associating with any worker-related collectivization or groups,
or for attempting to initiate or engaging in collectivizing or unionizing activities.
Trustworthy payroll
In the gig-based roles like data work, the way earnings are calculated, managed, and delivered is critical to labor
well-being. Issues like delays in payments, unpredictable availability of paid work, and low rates of remuneration
make earning through data work a challenge. Companies need to ensure that data workers can earn substantially
and on time, and that the systems governing pay are fair, predictable and transparent to workers.
Living and minimum wages
Companies should make arrangements to ensure that workers' take-home earnings exceed the minimum wage
stipulated by local laws and regulations. In the regions where living wage figures are available, companies have to
abide by living wages instead of minimum wages.
Payments for work-related labor beyond client tasks
Companies should remunerate the workers for the labor they complete in addition to their handling of data tasks. For
example, a considerable amount of unpaid labor gets done in completing tests and eligibility related tasks.
Payments in local national currency
By default, workers' remuneration should be paid in official national currency. Companies cannot force workers to
receive their earnings in alternative forms, such as cryptocurrency, gift cards, or digital currency.
This standard applies to any and all forms of money that is due to workers, including, but not limited to, salaries,
per-task pay, overtime pay, and bonuses and incentives.
Fixed schedule of payments
Regardless of whether they earn on a salary or per-task basis, all workers are to receive their pay as per the
schedule set by the organization. Changes to the schedule should be made after notifying all workers about the
impending change.
Auxiliary standards:
Workers who earn on a per-task basis or on platforms should receive their accrued earnings periodically,
based on a fixed schedule. For example, data workers’ earnings should be transferred to them at least once
a week without fail.
Workers earning on a per-task basis or on platforms should be able to request the transfer of their accrued
earnings before the scheduled payday. This provision should be available for use, at the very least, twice a
month.
Unconditional transfer of wages
Under no circumstances can a company delay or refuse to transfer a worker’s pay for completed work. Sending
people their earnings cannot be made conditional on things like surpassing metrics or adopting behaviours as
dictated by company management.
This standard applies to any and all payments due to data workers, be it “base pay” or “bonus pay.”
Access to payment records
All workers should be provided with accurate, up-to-date, downloadable, and printable records that describe the work
they have completed, the earnings due to them, and the status of past and pending payments. Workers receiving
electronic records only should also have an option to opt-in for receiving printed records.
A tentative and non-exhaustive list of information that the design of payment records can consider including is
provided below.
The data worker’s identification, featuring information like their full name, their designation, and
company-issued ID numbers.
The bill’s date of issue, the company’s method of payment.
The number and type of tasks completed, the project being serviced, and the worker’s supervisor.
The per-task rate, and the earnings due.
Any deductions made from dues on the grounds of tax requirements, worker penalties, or company charges.
Auxiliary standard: Companies should design workers' receipt documents in ways that make them usable with the
local tax authorities. The breakdown between any taxes deducted (including the rate of taxes), any commission
collected by the company or third parties, and the amount left for the data worker should be clearly depicted.
Share information about calculations
Companies should make the task pay calculation formulae, metrics, and processes transparent to the workers.
Changes to such systems should be indicated in the information provided to workers.
Payment monitoring and grievance redressal systems
Companies need dedicated personnel and resources to monitor remuneration processes and ensure timely and
correct payments. Workers should be provided with a dependable way to reach these assistance services for help
and to make inquiries.
Supportive workflows
Issues like inadequate specifications from clients, and insufficient training for completing tasks can make data
workers’ operations harder. Companies need to provide data workers with relevant capacity-building, sufficient
information on what they need to do, and reliable communication channels for support. Furthermore, workers should
be able to expect a reasonable level of transparency on the purpose of their work and the clients they service, and
their choices to accept or reject tasks should be respected.
Human involvement in communications
Companies should establish human-run communication channels where workers can directly interact with company
management to raise concerns and seek solutions. Workers should be notified of the availability of such
communication channels repeatedly, and they should be consulted to identify the format of communication mostappropriate for them. This standard does not necessarily require workers and company personnel to be physically
present in the same space.
Language choice in communications
All communications directed at a worker should, at the very least, be provided in their native language, or one that
they have indicated. Companies should take the necessary steps to accommodate workers who have disabilities or
difficulties.
This standard applies to the companies data workers work for, the clients they treat data for, and any supervisors,
managers, or data-quality personnel overseeing workers.
Training for workers
Companies should provide adequate training to ensure workers have the required knowledge and skills to complete
tasks efficiently. This training should be comprehensive enough to include information on topics like how the tasks
need to be done, what kind of guidelines should be followed, and how to operate the tools (software and so on)
involved in completing the work.
Dedicated and responsive support with tools, software, and platforms
Companies need to have a dedicated team for resolving issues and doubts data workers face with the digital tools
and software needed to fulfill various aspects of their roles, such as team communications, treating and enriching
data, submitting work, or anything else.
Auxiliary Standards: For any hardware or software tools companies require workers to install on their device,
companies need to disclose to workers the functioning and usage of these tools, including any recording or tracking
functions.
Preparing instructions for workers
Companies should work with the clients to develop clear instruction sets for workers' use. This involves companies
directly working with clients to draft instructions and consulting workers to ensure such information's adequacy.
Clarity on clients and datasets’ purpose(s)
Workers should be provided enough information for them to be able to know what kind of work they are involved in,
and for them to make informed decisions about their engagement with the role. To this end, companies should at
least share information with workers about the purpose of the data work they do, who the client is, and what the data
might be used for.
Auxiliary standard: Whenever a worker is assigned to a new project or client, they should be briefed on the nature of
the data and content they will handle, and any harms they could be exposed to in the process.
Setting reasonable quotas and targets, and allowing breaks
Companies’ project management and distribution of tasks must not put workers at risk of adverse effects like mental
health problems, health distress, and burnout.
The quotas for completing tasks need to be set such that workers should be able to meet their targets while being
able to take breaks that allow a sufficient amount of mental and physical recovery. Companies should develop
role-specific targets after consulting data workers involved in different kinds of tasks.Further guidance on setting quotas and targets can be found in Standard 3 in “Lasting Collaboration"" under Stage 03.
Reasonable time periods for task completion
Companies should provide workers with an adequate time frame within which they need to complete the tasks
assigned to them before management diverts the tasks elsewhere. Companies should build systems that alert
workers about deadlines and impending redirection of tasks.
Regularizing working hours
Companies should follow national regulation on working hours, and in the absence of such regulations, have working
days that are no longer than 6 hours.
Auxiliary standards for all models involving the handling of disturbing content: All workers who handle data that
contains disturbing content, should be given periodic breaks to recover from the potential toll of the work. Taking
these breaks should not affect the workers’ performance evaluation or pay calculation in any way.
Companies should also conduct some form of check-ins that ask workers about their well-being, and offer options for
support, breaks from the work, and, if available, long-term or temporary transfers to other projects or work
assignments.
Auxiliary standard : All workers that work on a purely task basis, without fixed hours or fixed shifts, can stop and
resume working as they see fit. Businesses cannot penalize workers for being flexible with their working hours and
engagement with the platform.
Explanations for rejected tasks
All workers should receive communication on why their submitted task was rejected or flagged as ""incorrect.""
Furthermore, they should be provided assistance and guidance on meeting clients’ and validators’ requirements.
Opportunity to correct rejected tasks and earn
Workers who earn on a per-task basis should receive a chance to retry rejected tasks at least once. Companies
should pay full amount to the workers on correctly completing the task in the second attempt.
Abstaining from tasks and projects
Workers can refuse to work on a particular project or for a client on the grounds of the content of the data they will
handle. Companies should not penalize workers for such decisions.
Critical protections
Workers need assurances and protections that allow them to derive a decent living from their work. It is possible for
data workers to run into adverse circumstances, like contracting a serious illness, or to suffer work-related injuries or
trauma. Such events can have severe impacts, such as diminishing people’s savings or hindering their ability to work
and earn. Unpredictability in the availability of paid work can disrupt earnings and their ability to care for themselves
and their household. Thus, companies need to arrange measures that act as safety nets, worker care for hazardous
work, and as guarantees on earnings.
Identify workers’ risks and harms
Companies need to assess the kinds of risks and harms data workers shoulder. Such assessments should be driven
by extensive interactions with workers across the different data work roles across the company. This informationshould feed the development of policies and care measures (discussed in Standard 2 and 3 in “Comprehensive Care”
under Stage 02) that provide assistance and support to workers in forms like hazard pay, insurance policies, and
access to wellness services like counselling.
Companies that lack policies and measures of worker care must, at the very least, observe strict redlines that prohibit
the organization’s involvement in projects requiring data workers to handle disturbing content.
Further guidance on care measures for data workers can be found in Standards 2, 3, and 4 in “Comprehensive Care”
under Stage 02.


Providing care measures for at-risk workers
Companies must provide data workers immediate and unconditional access to care measures should their role
involve disturbing content. These measures must be adequately equipped to aid workers, and responsive to risks and
distress.
Auxiliary standard: Data workers needing mental health care should be able to opt for external services rather than
have to engage with company-affiliated practitioners and programmes. There should be no restrictions on data
workers’ ability to discuss things with the mental health service provider.
Further guidance on care measures for data workers can be found in Standard 3 in “Comprehensive Care” under
Stage 02.
Workers’ choice to work longer hours
No worker can be forcibly signed on to work for more than 8 hours a day, including breaks without overtime pay. A
worker can refuse overtime, and should not be penalized for their decision.
This standard’s recommendation of 8 hours as the maximum length of the working day is tentative. Companies
should engage workers, unions, and relevant labor institutions to understand good practices, and set their policies
accordingly.
Periodic breaks for active workers
All workers that work on a shift basis, or are monitored on metrics like time spent working, should be entitled to 1 hour
long lunch break and 15 minutes of break for every 2 hours of work.
This standard’s recommendation of providing breaktime relative to the hours of work done is tentative. Companies
should engage workers, unions, and relevant labor institutions to understand good practices, and set their policies
accordingly.
This standard’s recommendation of providing breaktime relative to the hours of work done is tentative. Companies
should engage workers, unions, and relevant labor institutions to understand good practices, and set their policies
accordingly.
Workers’ leaves
All workers that work on a shift basis, or are monitored as they work, are entitled to paid time off, and to sick leaves,
commensurate with the local regulations.
Minimum earning opportunities for workers
In situations where workers do not earn fixed salaries, and/or they are required to meet periodic company-mandated
quotas, they should have a minimum workload available to them every week. This minimum workload represents the
minimum amount of earnings accessible to workers, and is, at the very least, equivalent to 1 week's worth of the local
minimum wage. If living wage rates exist for the area, then they must be applied instead of minimum wage numbers.
Auxiliary standard: Companies should introduce and maintain channels that provide workers with information about
projects and opportunities within the organization. The onus to locate and apply for earnings opportunities should not
be solely on workers.
Ensuring substantial periods of work
Companies need to ensure that they assign people work on as constant a basis as possible.
For example, workers should not be benched for weeks or months at a time, only to receive a tiny amount of work for
a few days, before they are left without paid work again.
Limiting unpaid time for workers and offering basic support
Workers should not be benched for more than three weeks at a time. Should benching exceed 21 days, then workers
should get paid the minimum workload amount's worth to them for every additional week they spend benched.
This standard’s recommendation of 21 days as the maximum unpaid benching time is tentative. Companies should
engage workers, unions, and relevant labor institutions to understand good practices, and set their policies
accordingly.
Advance warning of unpaid waiting periods
Companies should strive to notify workers no less than 14 days in advance of getting benched. This notice should
also indicate the estimated duration for the benching. Companies must inform workers whenever they are about to
have their benching extended.
This standard’s recommendation of 14 days as the minimum notice period for unpaid benching time is tentative.
Companies should engage workers, unions, and relevant labor institutions to understand good practices, and set their
policies accordingly.
Minimizing workers’ involvement in production costs
Companies should not require workers to absorb the material costs of accessing data work and completing tasks.
Companies should take ownership of workers' operating costs and work-related expenses in one of two possible
ways.
First, companies develop a reimbursement or financial assistance system based on discussions with workers and
observing the expenditure they incur to complete tasks.
For example, through discussions with workers, companies could pilot an internet access allowance, providing active
workers with a money transfer sufficient to pay for a net pack for downloading and submitting work.
Second, companies interact with workers to identify key points of operational spending for them, and then find some
way to provide these services or assets to workers.For example, workers who complete data work using their personal SIMs may be losing substantial amounts of their income to purchasing data packs. Companies can equip ground-level staff with internet hotspot devices that they can
visit workers with, reducing the operational burden on workers.
Some areas of coverage to consider on include, but are not limited to the following:
Damages and subsequent repairs for work-related equipment like phones and computers.
Internet connectivity packages needed to fulfill work requirements.
Travel services for the workers who must travel to a designated company workplace and cover long
distances.
Travel services for night shift workers.
Procurement of assistive devices like microphones and headphones for workers handling audio and speech
data related tasks.
Contestable termination
Opaque termination causes data workers to lose their source of income without a chance to adjust to clients and
companies’ needs, to defend themselves, or to appeal such decisions. Termination has been discussed as a format
for intimidation and retaliation against workers attempting to raise issues or take action. Termination practices need to
be transparent, justifiable,and should allow appeals and redressal for workers. Companies also need to ensure that
exiting workers are paid and their exit entitlements are fulfilled.
Termination policy governing removal of workers
Companies should provide a termination policy to workers that outlines the possible grounds for termination and the
notice period. No worker can be removed from the company for reasons outside the termination policy's contents.
Informing workers of impending termination
All workers should be given written notice about reasons and decisions related to their termination or non-renewal of
contracts in advance. This advance period should, at the very least, exceed 14 days. In addition to writing, such
notices should be communicated in additional formats that help the worker be informed about decisions regarding
their continued engagement with the company.
This standard’s recommendation of 14 days as the minimum notice period for termination is tentative. Companies
should engage workers, unions, and relevant labor institutions to understand good practices, and set their policies
accordingly.
Discussing termination and non-renewal with workers
Every worker should be able to have an interaction about decisions and reasons regarding possible termination or
non-renewal of contracts with human members of management. Such interactions can be in-person, or via some
technological means that is amenable to the worker.
Clearing payment dues with workers
Workers who have been asked to leave should be promptly paid any outstanding dues, including any form of
incentives or bonuses, for the work they have done till that point. Non-payment should carry some form of penalty,
such as companies having to pay 5% interest on the amount due for every day overdue. Workers should receive
updates and clear records of these processes.
This standard’s recommendation of 5% as the penalty for delays and non-payment of exiting workers’ dues is
tentative. Companies should engage workers, unions, and relevant labor institutions to understand good practices,
and set their policies accordingly.Auxiliary Standards: Companies with exit-related measures, such as severance or gratuity or any other
contribution-based measures, must ensure that such dues are also paid in a timely manner.
Human-mediation in termination processes
No workers can be terminated, or be rejected from contract renewal, at the sole discretion of algorithmic, automated
systems. A human being should oversee all decisions pertaining to workers' termination and/or non-renewal of their
contracts, and appeals processes.
Appeals process for termination decisions
All workers who are facing termination or non-renewal are entitled to an appeals process. Such appeals should
involve the worker meeting company personnel who make termination and non-renewal decisions. Workers are
entitled to having assistive figures present, like labor representatives, legal counsel, and any other form of aid local
laws and regulations allow.
Stage 02
The standards in the second stage focus on co-creating workflow design and worker-facing systems with the data
workers. Companies need to integrate measures into their business models and workflows to ensure worker safety,
provide social security, offer fair wages that reflect actual effort, support upskilling and grant credentials. Together, the
first two stages aim to manage precarities and develop fair processes across the data work companies’ workflows
and governance structures.
Comprehensive care
Data workers can engage in tasks and workflows that can harm them, such as in content moderation or the handling
of disturbing images for AI training. Over time, companies need to design, introduce, and manage “care measures”
that meaningfully help adversely affected workers, and provide compensation that reflects the risks and harms
workers bear.


Hazard pay for dangerous forms of work
Companies need to have a ""hazard pay"" system in place for work that can harm the workers handling the
data/content. At the very least, hazard pay rates should comply with local laws and regulations.
Auxiliary standard: Hazard pay should be arranged based on consultations with workers, worker representatives and
collective organizations like unions that represent data workers. The Hazard pay rate should be revised periodically
(such as when new kinds of tasks are introduced within the company's workforce), and the recalculation process
needs to be participatory and transparent to workers.


Connecting workers to health and safety measures
Data workers must be provided protections and assistance that assist them through forms of distress like sickness,
the inability to work, or potential adverse effects of work. Companies can utilize existing protections and institutions,
but must ensure that workers have aid and support that matches the level of risk and harm their roles entail.
Enrollment in existing measures: Should there be government-driven systems of support in place, for things
like insurance and healthcare, companies can direct workers towards these services. If data workers require
assistance or face access barriers, then companies should assist them with joining and using these
programmes.Introducing relevant measures: In cases where government-run programmes are absent in the area, or not
extended to data workers, companies are responsible for providing such services. These services need to
deliver adequate levels of aid that are easy and quick to avail.
Auxiliary standard: Companies need to be permissive in giving data workers time to seek treatment and assistance.
Workers should not be penalized, have their pay reduced, or have their performance evaluations downrated, for time
spent in seeking aid. If they have depleted the sick leaves they are entitled to, workers should regardless be given
penalty-free opportunities to use care measures.


Defining and upholding a duty of care policy
Companies need to have a “duty of care policy” (DoC) guaranteeing support and assistance that is aligned to risks
and problems identified by data workers. As discussed in Standard 2 and 3 in “Critical Protections” under Stage 01,
companies that have not developed and implemented a DoC policy and care mechanisms must adopt and adhere to
institutional redlines. These redlines must prohibit companies from accepting projects that put workers in roles
featuring disturbing content.
Auxiliary standard: Information on a company’s duty of care policy must be easily available for workers’ perusal.
Informing workers should not be restricted to mailing them policies, but need to consider methods like having people
on the ground who can answer questions, and conducting orientations on DoC policies and changes.


Accountable management of care mechanisms
Enrollment and membership processes for company-run care mechanisms need to prioritize workers’ ability to
access and use services. Ideally, care mechanisms need to be universally provided. Should companies use some
form of eligibility criteria, they should be clearly communicated to the workers and the companies should strive to
make these requirements reasonable and contestable.
Contestability: Workers should be able to check and contest any data that is collected for eligibility purposes.
For example, if attendance tracking is used to decide insurance eligibility, then workers should be able to
check these records, and access grievance redressal if they have problems in the attendance logged.
Reasonableness: For workers not handling disturbing materials, eligibility conditions for care mechanisms
should be minimalistic and, as far as possible, have short “qualifying periods” for being able to use services.
As mentioned in Standard 3 in “Critical Protections” under Stage 02, data workers with hazardous roles must
have access to care mechanisms upon starting such projects.
For example, workers should not have to wait six months to be eligible for protections like insurance.
Something like having completed a thirty-day period of completing tasks should be enough to qualify them
for company-run care mechanisms.
Auxiliary standard: When government-run services lack the provisions necessary to provide care that aligns with the
risks and harms of the work, companies should make appropriate arrangements. These arrangements should be
substantial enough to cover the cost of seeking the treatments or assistance for the harms their roles can cause.
For example, if a data worker’s treatment, recovery, or prevention involves medication as well as therapy, the
company-provided care mechanisms need to cover the entire cost involved.
Co-designed operationsThere can be a disconnect between how policies are designed by companies and the conditions data workers
experience on the ground. There are tasks that require repeated attempts and considerable effort to satisfy data
requirements, but pay out small sums. Discussions between labor and workers on matters like performance
evaluation, or how task rates consider workers’ time and effort, can help build fairer processes for reviewing and
compensating data workers.


Collaborate with workers to develop task rates
Companies should work with the workers to understand and consider the ground realities which plays a role in
determining the actual time and effort that goes into fulfilling the tasks. Based on this data, companies should work
with the workers to set the task rates.
This standard is further expanded upon in Standard 2 in “Lasting Collaboration” under Stage 3.


Worker consultation for performance metrics
In arrangements where workers are required to fulfill metrics set by the management, periodic consultations between
companies and its workers must be held. In these consultations, workers can raise issues on any adverse effects and
strain caused by existing metrics , and can recommend alteration in order to maintain workers' health and ability to
work.
Visible workers
Data workers commit substantial amounts of effort to learn different tools and meet eligibility requirements for various
task formats. Data workers lack ways to record and present their work experience and skill development, something
which is crucial for career progression and seeking new earning opportunities. Companies need to recognise data
workers as assets and contributors, and provide opportunities and testimonials to them. Initiatives like providing
work-experience records and skilling programs can help data workers manage their careers and navigate uncertain
job markets.


Furnish workers with credentials
Companies need to implement a system for providing workers with formal records and certification, which they can
use to apply elsewhere and build a body of work experience.
For example, companies can develop “skill passports” that leave data workers with attested records of their
experience and competencies.
Auxiliary Standard: Companies should work to provide records that can be recognized by businesses within and
beyond the data work sector. Workers need to have sufficient proof of their engagement with data work companies,
some way to carry forward data regarding their reputation and performance, and reasonably descriptive accounts of
their work experience and proficiencies.


Enable upskilling among workers
Companies need to arrange or build skilling programs that help workers to either transition to better-paying data work
roles, or to pursue opportunities in other professions and organizations.


Transparency in worker evaluation
Companies need to administer data workers’ pay increases, promotions, and evaluations in a transparent manner.
Companies need to provide workers with clear, up-to-date and accurate information on how career progression andindividual evaluation works within the organization, covering topics like promotions, pay adjustment, feedback,
penalties, and applying for new roles.


Stage 03
The level of policy engagement with data work and its problems is unevenly distributed across the world. Companies
can look to international guidance on topics like labour welfare, responsible business practices, and human rights to
think about how to build better workplaces. Beyond looking outwards for guidance, companies should engage with
external initiatives to assess conditions and practice, discuss labor issues, and design improvements.
Receptive governance
The level of policy engagement with data work and its problems is unevenly distributed across the world. Companies
can look to international guidance on topics like labour welfare, responsible business practices, and human rights to
think about how to build better workplaces. Beyond looking outwards for guidance, companies should engage with
external initiatives to assess conditions and practice, discuss labor issues, and design improvements.


Integrate rights frameworks and charters into company governance
Companies need to adopt frameworks and take steps to uphold human rights in the workplaces they manage. They
should conduct human rights impact assessments and release publicly available reports.


Openness to third-party inspections
In addition to publishing publicly accessible reports discussing their labour practices, companies should develop the
practice of hosting external assessments of working conditions and socioeconomic trends of data work. It should be
possible for external parties representing labour, civil society, or the state, to attempt research and assessments
focusing on data workers without interference or hindrance from businesses.
Auxiliary standard: When companies open their doors to external parties for reasons like research or assessment,
they need to enable the visiting party to choose how they conduct their work and interact with people. Companies
need to refrain from attempting to control or influence the information or testimonies external parties can access.
Lasting collaboration
A growing number of voices are talking about the risks and problems data workers face. Data work has been
associated with issues like low pay, unpaid labor, uncertainty in getting paid work, precariously short contracts,
intense work pressure, and adverse effects on health and mental well-being. Directly engaging workers and unions is
key to understanding problems within and beyond the workflow. Such engagement can help address labor conditions
in ways that are useful to workers and improve the workflows driving the business.


Work with labor stakeholders
Formally acknowledge collective organizations and engage in negotiation efforts with them. Companies need to be
ready to form and implement agreements with stakeholders like unions. Workers must be safe from company-side
penalties or retaliation for participating in or initiating collective action.


Co-design a pay system for remunerating effort, not tasks
Companies should co-develop a process with the workers for remunerating the basic effort involved in tasks, with
tasks’ “correctness” no longer being the defining criteria. Through this protocol, the workers must be given a chanceto negotiate the wages as per the amount of effort needed and skills committed in completing the tasks in question.
This standard applies to the entirety of the compensation possible for a worker, including, but not limited to, base pay,
bonus and incentive pay, and hazard pay. Companies need to conduct this co-development process with workers at
least once a year.
They should also open up discussions whenever they introduce new kinds of tasks and roles to the workforce.
For example, if a data work company starts taking content moderation contracts, they should initiate discussions on
how earnings will be calculated, regardless of whether one such meeting has already been held that year.


Sustainable work targets
Companies need to have a well-defined process for how they set the “quotas” or “targets” workers need to meet
within a particular time period (in an hour, in a day, by the end of the week, and so on). Workers and businesses need
to work together to set targets such that workers are not at risk of suffering from adverse effects like burnout,
worsening worse stress, and health conditions.
Co-designed targets can be seen as the “optimal workload” that lies between ensuring that everyone can earn
substantial amounts of pay, and that company quotas are not causing worker distress or putting their well-being at
risk.


Transitions into full employment
For long-serving workers, companies need to create and provide the option for them to transition from a contractor
position to full employment. Workers should also be able to seek letters of service from the company that attest to
their work experience and possibly offer commendation.


Routinely consult workers about changes and issues
Establish consultation mechanisms where companies discuss key issues, like pay, and co-design solutions and
changes. Workers must not be penalized, disciplined, or called out for attempting to raise issues, discussing changes,
and calling for action.

This section discusses our thinking on guiding values and considering business models types when developing the
standards for data work. Please get in touch with us with any questions or ideas you have!
I. Glossary
Data workers
Working people who handle data materials as per the specifications of their companies and paying clients, for
purposes like the training of artificial intelligence (AI) or the moderation of user-generated content in online spaces.
Data workers fulfill numerous roles, ranging from labelling images to responding to tickets regarding disturbing
content on social media to helping evaluate large language models (LLMs). Data work can be conducted through
different business models, like business process outsourcing (BPO) and digital labour platforms (DLPs). It is
important to note that data work is not a fixed category of roles. It refers to a wide variety of roles, with the possibility
of new roles emerging that exhibit the characteristics of data work.
Workflow
The processes, policies, infrastructure, and people that manage the working environment in which data workers
operate.
Disturbing Materials and Content/ Riskier Work
Tasks and data that feature content that can cause physical and mental health harms, or put people at risk of adverse
effects, either through short-term or sustained exposure. Some examples of disturbing materials include hate speech,
footage and imagery of graphic violence, content featuring sexual abuse, and online posts displaying the abuse of
children.
At-Risk Workers
The workers who routinely handle disturbing materials, be it for content moderation roles or otherwise, are classified
as at-risk workers. This term is not being used with intent to reduce the experiences of other categories of data
workers, but to highlight that some people have to face not only precarious work engagements but also handle large
volumes of content that people should not have to endure under any circumstances.
Care Mechanism
The various services and measures companies design, adopt, and manage to provide aid and support to data
workers. Care mechanisms can range from providing insurance to reducing or covering operating costs involved in
data work.
II. Core Values
Based on our research and understanding of the precarities faced by data workers in the ecosystem, we developed a
set of values that act as the fundamental criteria for creating a safe working environment and promoting workers’
well-being. These values form the core basis on which the standards are formulated. Standards are different
pathways to make these values actionable. Hence, every standard is associated with one or more of these core
values.
Freedom
Workers should be able to exercise their rights and seek external recourse, remedy, and counsel without interference,
coercion, or intimidation from workplaces. Restrictions on workers’ discussing their work and experiences with
external parties should be applied only when it is absolutely necessary for the sake of the client or sensitivities
surrounding the data.
Recognition
The companies running workplaces should have a full grasp of the realities of data work and the production
processes. Businesses must be cognizant of the time, effort, skill, risks, and even danger that data work can require,
and provide their workforces with adequate levels of compensation, support, and aid.
TransparencyData work relationships need to be transparent in ways that empower and equip workers with key information about
their roles, their engagement with companies, and the production processes they enable. Businesses need to work to
provide workers with a variety of information, ranging from clear explanations of their relationship with the companies
and how they are managed to how wages are calculated and how worker performance is measured, recognized, and
penalized.
Stability
Data work roles should be designed and managed in ways that provide a meaningful level of stability to people
fulfilling companies data requirements. Stability itself would arise from companies achieving adequacy in critical
labour areas, such as compensation, managing the time workers spend “benched,” social security and hazard-related
measures, and worker assistance.
Support
Workplaces need to offer data workers tools, processes, and assistance that help them fulfill their roles safely and
with minimal barriers. Companies need to build and maintain measures that protect workers’ safety, address
emerging safety issues and hazards, and ensure that workers have the means and information necessary to
complete work and earn.
Collaboration
The process of arranging projects and delivering AI-related services should be governed such that there is plenty of
space for discussions and co-designing the workflow. Companies should engage workers as more than a source of
feedback, and work with labour stakeholders to shape production pipelines and workers’ arrangements. Furthermore,
companies themselves should move to open themselves to external initiatives geared towards impact assessments
and understanding working conditions.
III. Model cognizance in developing standards
The data enrichment industry consists of a range of business models. Data work’s challenges as well as the
pathways for pursuing ethical treatment of labor, can differ based on companies' business models. There are a
number of “model-specific standards” that are meant for following two broad type of business models:
Business Process Outsourcing/ BPO: Set-ups where workers produce data under company supervision,
possibly in a designated location rather than an online environment. BPO models may run offices outfitted
with various assets and infrastructures that allow workers to function in their roles. One prominent example
of the BPO model is the French firm, Teleperformance.
Digital Labor Platforms/ DLP: Arrangements that utilize the internet and various software to link different
players and processes of data production together, allowing people otherwise separated to collaborate and
exchange money, goods, and services. DLP models treat workers as independent entities who may need to
arrange things like computers, phones, and internet needed for work through their own resourcefulness and
funds. Amazon Mechanical Turk and Remotasks are examples of DLPs offering data work solutions.
These model-specific standards are marked by a tag that reads as “BPO” for Business Process Outsourcing, and
“DLP” for Digital Labor Platforms.",6767,"['stage', '01', 'first', 'stage', 'serf', 'checklist', 'roadmap', 'addressing', 'documented', 'precarities', 'surrounding', 'data', 'worker', 'standard',

On a sunny afternoon in Nairobi, Kenya, a data worker receives
footage from a Roomba vacuum. The worker labels the objects
that the Roomba encounters, such as table legs and floor lamps,
in order to teach it to avoid obstacles, and identifies a carpet
so that the vacuum learns when it should apply greater suction.
Another data worker is given a one-minute pornographic video.
The worker types a list of 40 hashtags that describe the video
based on the characteristics of the actors–the color of their hair
or skin, the size and features of their bodies–so that the video
can be categorized for search results. A third data worker is
provided images of a murder victim at a crime scene. The worker
zooms into an image to trace the outline of a bullet wound and
a smashed skull, and labels them as such, to train AI to perform
post-mortem analyses. A final worker monitors reels on TikTok,
flagging user-generated content for infractions of the platform’s
terms, such as violent threats or graphic footage.
The seamless functionality of artificial intelligence and the
relative safety of online spaces are made possible by a vast,
often hidden, global workforce. Data labelers and content
moderators form the essential human infrastructure for the
world’s largest technology firms, performing critical tasks that
machines have not mastered. Labelers meticulously annotate
images, text, and videos–training the algorithms that power
everything from facial recognition and self-driving cars to
chatbots and recommendation engines. Content moderators
serve as the frontline guardians of online platforms–”digital
first responders”–reviewing vast quantities of user-generated
content to identify and remove harmful material, including hate
speech, misinformation, and graphic imagery. These workers
are fundamental to building trustworthy AI and maintaining
the integrity of the virtual world, yet their contributions are
undervalued and obscured from public view.
Introduction
This report focuses on data workers in a growing technology
hub: Nairobi, Kenya. Fueled by a young, educated, tech-savvy
population, a workforce with cultural and linguistic proficiency,
an economy with globally competitive labor costs, and
significant government efforts to lure tech-related investment,
Kenya has emerged as a center for digital labor. Thousands
of Kenyans are employed by business process outsourcing
companies (BPOs) or work for online labor platforms,
undertaking data annotation and content moderation on behalf
of major global corporations. A defining characteristic of the
digital economy, in Kenya and elsewhere, is the complex web of
outsourcing relationships. Major tech companies rarely employ
labelers or moderators directly. Instead, they contract the work
to large multinational BPOs or specialized platforms that, in
turn, often subcontract parts of the work to smaller, local BPOs
or use labor brokers to enlist workers from local labor markets.
The layers of subcontracting in digital supply chains create
opacity: workers at the end of the chain have no visibility into
the end client whose products they are building or safeguarding.
Outsourcing has profound impacts on working conditions, as
layers of intermediaries skim margins and make it difficult for
workers to hold lead firms accountable for labor violations or
poor treatment. This report sheds light on the experiences of
Kenyan data workers at the far reaches of digital supply chains
and offers recommendations based on workers’ desires for
improved working conditions.
Methodology and Sample
During July 2025, the Data Labellers Association administered
an in-person survey to digital supply chain workers in Kenya
to better understand their working conditions and the impacts
of this work on their wellbeing, yielding 226 valid surveys.
All survey responses are anonymous. The sample includes data
labellers (87%), content moderators (8%), and other digital
workers such as transcribers (5%). Of these respondents,
54% worked for online platforms and 46% were employed by
BPOs. Among the respondents who worked for BPOs, 19 firms
were represented.
In terms of educational attainment, 39% of respondents have
earned a bachelor’s degree, 39% have completed some university
studies, 22% have a high school diploma, and 1% have a master’s
degree. The top areas of study were computer science (22%),
engineering (11%), and business administration (10%).
More than one-quarter (28%) of respondents are age 20 to 25,
more than half (54%) are 26 to 31 years old, 17% are 32 to 37 years
old, and 2% are 38 years old or older (Figure 1).
Fifty-eight percent of respondents were men and 42%
were women.
All respondents were born in Kenya.
Outsourced Work in Digital Supply Chains
Leading global corporations, including technology firms, major
retailers, and online platforms, outsource essential data tasks
like content moderation and AI training to BPOs and digital
labor platforms. These BPOs and platforms manage global
workforces of data workers who perform tasks according to the
end clients’ specifications, while workers have little insight into
who their work benefits and how it will be used.
While most data workers opt to work for either a BPO or a
platform, 23% of workers surveyed are working for both a BPO
and a platform, an indication of workers’ attempts to diversify
income sources and increase their take-home pay.
Workers hired by BPOs are likely to have an employment
contract with their employer (82%). Yet one quarter of those
workers say they do not understand everything in their
contract. Nearly all (93%) of BPO workers are asked to sign a
non-disclosure agreement as a condition of employment, which
can have consequences for speaking out about substandard
conditions or other workplace challenges.
Platform workers are far less likely than those employed by
BPOs to have a contract with the platform they use most
frequently (26%), and of those, two-thirds (67%) do not
understand everything in their contract. Contract documents
can be lengthy and use legal language unfamiliar to workers.
Thirty-four percent of platform workers report being asked to
sign a non-disclosure agreement.
Non-payment of work is a common issue: more than half
of platform workers (53%) report that, in the past year, they
have done platform work and not been paid for the tasks they
completed. Workers report tasks being rejected, often with no
explanation, account deactivation without notice or recourse,
and waiting long periods between task completion and payment.
Lack of payment and delayed payment can have substantial
impacts on workers’ financial insecurity, a topic we turn to next.
Data Workers Face Mounting Financial Hardships
Despite playing a critical role in the digital economy, many data
workers face persistent financial hardships. With inadequate
job security and compensation well below a living wage, they
struggle to meet basic needs, including paying for housing,
healthcare, and education and childcare, even as their labor fuels
the development of cutting-edge technologies. This disconnect
between the value of their contributions and their economic
personal realities underscores the growing inequality in digital
supply-chain labor markets.

comfortably afford housing?
When asked whether in the
past two months they were
able to comfortably cover
their housing costs, the vast
majority of respondents–69%
–indicated that they are not
able to do so (Figure 2).
Nearly three in four
respondents (73%) reported
that in the past two months,
they were not able to
comfortably cover childcare
or school fees (Figure 3).

5 In the last two months, were you able to
comfortably afford food?
When asked whether in the
past two months they were
able to comfortably cover the
costs of their medications
and medical fees, 59% of
respondents indicated that
they are not able to do so
(Figure 4).
Nearly half of respondents
(47%) reported that over the
past two months, they were not
able to comfortably afford the
cost of food (Figure 5).
Because of the challenges data
workers face in covering the
costs of basic necessities, many
also face difficulties paying for
work-related expenses. Nearly
half (47%) indicated that in the
past two months, they were
not able to comfortably cover
the costs of internet service
(Figure 6), and 55% were not
able to comfortably cover their
transportation costs (Figure 7).

Health Risks for Data Workers
Impacts of Working as a Data Worker
on Physical Health
Data work poses significant physical and mental health risks
to workers. Many data annotators and content moderators
experience isolation, inadequate support from their employer,
and burnout. Physically, both roles involve prolonged
sedentary periods staring at screens, which can lead to eye
strain, headaches, repetitive injuries such as carpal tunnel
syndrome, and musculoskeletal disorders resulting from poor
ergonomics. While 54% of survey respondents report that
working as a data worker has had no impact on their physical
health, 36% report a negative impact, and just 9% report a
positive impact (Figure 8). By far, the leading negative impact
is degraded eyesight and eye strain as a result of prolonged
screen time, followed by back pain that comes from sitting for
extended periods.
Mentally, the impacts of
data work can be severe,
particularly for content
moderators who are regularly
exposed to graphic, violent,
or disturbing material. Data
annotators, depending on the
project, also face psychological
risks, while even mundane
annotation tasks can lead to
fatigue and low morale due
to repetition and pressure to
intensify the pace of work.
The survey finds that 48% of
data annotators report that
working as a data worker has
had no impact on their mental
health, 27% report a negative
impact, and 25% report a
positive impact (Figure 9).10 Health Risks for Data Workers
figure 9 Impacts of Working as a Data Worker on
Mental Health
The most commonly reported
negative impacts are
insomnia, anxiety, stress, and
depression. Underreporting is
common with mental health
issues, given the continued
stigma surrounding
psychological challenges, so
these are likely conservative
estimates. The sample size of
content moderators is too
small to allow for separate
analysis, but we believe the
prevalence of negative mental
health impacts is considerably
higher among content
moderators.
Eighteen percent of data workers report having to repeatedly
view content that was violent or disturbing, and the vast
majority (80%) report that viewing disturbing content caused
them to experience negative feelings. Many workers keep
these feelings to themselves, lacking a person with whom they
feel comfortable sharing such difficult experiences. Workers
report that some employers (41%) offer what they call “wellness
coaches” to support workers, but many workers say they fear
that the information they share will be used against them.
Others lack confidence that talking with a wellness coach
would be helpful.11 Data Worker Demands
Data workers are essential to the functioning of today’s
digital economy, yet many continue to face low pay, insecure
employment, and health challenges related to their work.
In response, data workers are developing an employer code
of conduct that affirms workers’ right to fair treatment
and dignified labor. This includes improvements in pay that
reflect the value of their contributions, reasonable working
hours and predictable scheduling, transparent and secure
contracts, and access to essential benefits such as mental health
and medical care. These standards are not only a matter of
fairness—they are foundational to building a more ethical and
sustainable digital economy.
Survey respondents identified four key components of more
fair and equitable employment. The first concerns pay: the most
commonly cited desire is changes in pay standards, principally
the need to raise pay rates. As the survey data showing
widespread financial hardships makes clear, data workers in
Kenya routinely struggle to cover their basic living expenses.
Employment insecurity is a reality for many, if not most, data
workers in Kenya. Because of this, a second key demand is the
adoption of longer-tenure, legally binding contracts written
in language workers understand. Many data workers operate
as independent contractors or through layers of subcontracting,
which strips them of job security, benefits, and avenues
for recourse against substandard working conditions. This
precariousness contributes to a constant sense of instability
and pressure to accept any available work, regardless of its
impact on workers’ well-being.12 Data Worker Demands
Relatedly, respondents called for revisions to company
policies governing work hours. This includes calls to reduce
the required number of work hours, allowances for greater
working time flexibility, and the easing of deadlines that require
overly long workdays. Data annotators often face sporadic
work schedules, ambiguous task instructions, and constant
performance monitoring. Mistakes can lead to immediate
loss of income or access to future assignments. Data workers
are employed in high-pressure environments, often under
conditions that are physically, psychologically, and emotionally
taxing. Underlying the demand to alter scheduling practices is
the need to alleviate some of the work stresses that have been so
debilitating for the workforce.
In recognition of the physical and mental hardships faced by
data workers, a fourth demand concerns the need for companies
to provide better mental health counseling as well as medical
insurance. Data workers involved in content moderation
are frequently exposed to graphic and disturbing material—
such as violence, hate speech, and sexual abuse—at a rapid pace,
sometimes reviewing hundreds of items per day. This has led
to widespread reports of trauma, depression, and substance
abuse among workers, especially in outsourced operations.
Companies in the digital economy bear some responsibility for
the harmful exposures to which workers are subjected, and they
must do more to safeguard their well-being. Harms could be at
least partially mitigated by (a) contracts that provide greater
transparency about work tasks and ensure workers’ informed
consent to undertake these tasks, (b) a more robust support
infrastructure that helps workers cope with the emotional toll
of these tasks, and (c) more worker-friendly scheduling that
eases the burdens associated with intense periods of exposure
to harmful material.",2300,"['introduction', 'sunny', 'afternoon', 'nairobi', 'kenya', 'data', 'worker', 'receives', 'footage', 'roomba', 'vacuum', 'worker', 'label', 'object', 'roomba', 'encounter',

TikTok German workers strike demands,ver.di,https://uniglobalunion.org/news/tiktok-content-moderators-strike-ai-berlin/,Demands,Union (or federation),Content moderators,Germany,07-01-2025,verdi.txt,"﻿Workers at TikTok’s Berlin headquarters are on strike today, 23 July, to protest the company’s refusal to negotiate conditions of an announced mass firing of 150 content moderators. The layoffs come as part of the social media platform’s plan to shutter its Trust and Safety Department and shift critical moderation work to AI and external providers. 
Workers, who have spent recent months training the AI systems now slated to replace them, are rallying under the banner: “We trained your machines – pay us what we deserve!” 
German union ver.di, a UNI affiliate, called the strike with clear demands: 
Severance payments equal to three years’ salary per employee 
12-month extension of the notice period 
The employees say such support is crucial not only to recognize their skilled labour but also to help them retrain and transition into new careers – particularly necessary for workers whose residency status in Germany depends upon employment. 
These steps are needed in recognition of the severe stress and trauma the job can create, and considering TikTok generates over US$23 billion annually – partly thanks to their labour – moderators argue their modest demands for fair severance and transition support are fully justified.  
“It is disrespectful of TikTok to shirk all social responsibility and even refuse to negotiate with us. Today, the employees are sending a clear signal that they will not accept this. They are going on strike and, in doing so, becoming pioneers of union organizing in the platform economy,” says Lucas Krentel, Deputy Regional Head of the Media Division at ver.di Berlin-Brandenburg. 
ver.di warns that by outsourcing content moderation, TikTok evades responsibility for fair pay, adequate psychological support and stable working conditions – further degrading already demanding work. Moderators emphasize that AI cannot adequately handle culturally sensitive decisions, and human oversight is essential to a safe platform. 
“Content moderators are essential to making the internet safe and usable, but companies like TikTok too often degrade their conditions and devalue the work of these professionals. Today’s strike is an important moment where content moderators are demanding recognition for all they’ve done – and sacrificed – to protect TikTok users. We stand with ver.di and with moderators everywhere who are organizing, speaking out and fighting back,” said Benjamin Parton, Head of UNI’s ICTS sector. 
On a global level, UNI has supported the first-ever trade union alliance of content moderators  to fight for living wages, safe working conditions and union representation in their industry. Last month, the alliance launched a comprehensive health and safety protocol for safer, sustainable content moderation.

Google Help workers union contract with Accenture,Alphabet Workers Union / CWA,https://www.alphabetworkersunion.org/press/google-help-workers-ratify-collective-contract-with-accenture-first-in-alphabet-workers-union-cwa-history,CBAs and union legal agreements,Union (or federation),Data workers,United States,12-01-2024,awu.txt,"﻿Today, Alphabet Workers Union-CWA members on the Google Help team secured a first collective contract with Google vendor Accenture, becoming the first group of AWU-CWA represented workers to bargain a collective contract and only the second group of Google office workers ever to do so.
‍
“We're proud to be one of the few tech contractors in the US to secure a collectively-bargained contract. Many large tech companies have moved away from directly employing workers to avoid providing the benefits and security that they deserve. We hope this contract demonstrates to all tech workers that it's possible to demand respect, fair treatment, and improve your working conditions,” said Mike Batilla, Lead Writer and member of Alphabet Workers Union-CWA.
‍
Reaching this contract sets a precedent for temporary, vendor, and contract workers in the tech industry, who too often receive the lowest wages and fewest protections of any tech workers, and whose numbers have been growing as the industry increasingly “vendorizes” its workforce. Now some of Alphabet’s most precarious workers have united to win meaningful protection against the further depression of their working conditions and security in an industry in flux. 
‍
Notable provisions of the contract include:
Guaranteed fully remote work
Six weeks of severance in the event of layoffs
30 day notice of layoffs
A prohibition on keystroke and mouse monitoring software
‍
This group of subcontracted workers first organized to improve their working conditions in 2021 and afterward unionized with Alphabet Workers Union-CWA. On June 7, 2023, 118 Google Help workers voted overwhelmingly to form a union, but shortly thereafter Google laid off all but 40 of them. The 26 workers in the unit today persevered in the face of adversity and have won meaningful security for themselves and future coworkers. Accenture engaged with them at the bargaining table in good faith, and today AWU-CWA can announce a ratified contract that includes significant protections and improvements including guaranteed remote work, severance, just cause termination, and more. 
‍
“Today’s victory underscores the importance of solidarity across the artificial barriers which corporations increasingly rely on to lower labor standards and reduce worker power. This contract is proof that full time and contract workers can unite to secure meaningful protections and improvements at work and that the wall-to-wall, premajority union model can be a force for change in our industry,” said Parul Koul, Software Engineer and President of Alphabet Workers Union-CWA.

UNI and Teleperformance have started implementation of the global agreement ,UNI and Teleperformance,https://uniglobalunion.org/news/uni-global-union-and-teleperformance-celebrate-achievements-after-one-year-of-global-agreement/,CBAs and union legal agreements,Union (or federation),BPO workers generally,"Colombia, El Salvador, Jamaica, Poland and Romania",12-01-2022,teleperformance.txt,"﻿On the first anniversary of their landmark global agreement, UNI Global Union and Teleperformance are marking a year of accelerated progress in strengthening workers’ rights and improving the health and safety of employees, particularly content moderators, across the company’s global operations.
The three-year pact, which was sealed on 1 December 2022, is the first of its kind in the business services sector and covers nearly 500,000 Teleperformance employees in 95 countries. It is based on the recognition of core labour rights as established by the International Labour Organization and respect for the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.
UNI and Teleperformance have started implementation of the global agreement in Colombia, El Salvador, Jamaica, Poland and Romania, representing over 50,000 workers.
The implementation agreements signed in these countries flesh out the terms of the global pact, and in real terms, they confirm and secure workers the right to organize in freedom and autonomy, while allowing unions access to Teleperformance workers both on-site and remotely.
More countries, outside the initial five, are now in the process of negotiating their own implementation agreements.
UNI and Teleperformance have used the global agreement’s provisions to form an international working party on health and safety, which brings together management, workers, experts and UNI trade union affiliates to look at health and safety risks.
Christy Hoffman, General Secretary of UNI Global Union, said:
“Teleperformance is leading the way in its industry for respecting human rights due diligence. Together with the company and unions on the ground, we are making our global agreement a reality by improving safety for workers, especially content moderators. We look forward to deepening our relationships with management at all levels of the corporation to further training and recognition for freedom of association and collective bargaining.”
Olivier Rigaudy, Deputy CEO of Teleperformance, said:
“Teleperformance is deeply committed to Corporate Social Responsibility and has been a signatory of the UN Global Compact since 2011.

Turkers demands to Mturk,Turkopticon,https://blog.turkopticon.net/?p=2623,Demands,Labor organization (other),Platform workers generally,United States,08-18-2022,turkopticon.txt,"﻿We call on the leaders to:
1. Limit the number of rejections the platform will allow to affect a worker’s approval rate when a requester rejects all work (i.e. 10 rejections per day would affect the approval rating, the others would, of course, still be rejected, but only the first 10 would affect the worker’s rating.)
2. Consult with the coalition of worker forums to problem-solve together to create solutions and improve Mechanical Turk for everyone.
Amazon Mechanical Turk is used by thousands of workers daily; all taking the chance of being mass rejected without protection. Turkopticon provides a space for workers to report these conditions, but we need more. Workers want to feel safe while working on the platform and have protection from mass rejections. Workers believe in rejections because unfortunately, there are bad workers, but good workers are getting unjustly hurt by them. Limiting the number of rejections that can affect a worker’s approval rating is something workers all agree will help everyone, including requesters. Requesters, especially new unrated ones, will get their work completed quicker because the fear of mass rejection will disappear.
Why is this important?

Covalen contractors open letter,DATA (Digital and Techworker Alliance) Communications Workers’ Union (CWU) Ireland,CWU description of open letter; Press coverage,Demands,Union (or federation),Content moderators,Ireland,07-01-2025,cwu.txt,"﻿It’s content moderation workers – the people who, day
in and day out, filter out the worst forms of violence
and abuse that might otherwise reach your phones and
computers. They train AI programmes so that these
systems don’t return answers that support violent or
abusive acts, or generate content along those lines.
When it comes to Facebook, Instagram, and
WhatsApp – social media tools owned by the tech
multinational Meta – this work in Ireland is carried out
by workers who have joined DATA-CWU and begun to
build their own union in a company called Covalen.
These union members are the guardians of the internet
as you experience it through these Meta applications.
The workforce is extremely diverse, coming from a
wide range of backgrounds, ages, races, nationalities,
genders, and sexualities – with most workers not
originally from Ireland. Many are on work visas, and
the vast majority spend most of their salaries on
Dublin rents. CWU Organisers John Bohan and Shane
Murphy have been supporting members in Covalen
to build the power they need to improve conditions
in their workplace and win the respect they deserve.
Membership is increasing at quick and consistent pace
as workers come together to stand up for what’s right.
“How can I say without blowing into the details?
Probably some of you already watch the Dexter series
on Netflix, or the Jeffrey Dahmer documentary. Yeah, so
if you saw that documentary, you know our job. We are
exposed to this kind of content – but 100 times more
disturbing.” – DATA-CWU Covalen Rep, Seminar 2025
Covalen is a subsidiary of the Irish company CPL,
which provides temporary and permanent staff to the
technology, accounting and finance, sales, engineering,
light industrial, healthcare, pharmaceutical, and office
admin sectors. It employs over 13,000 people across
around 45 offices worldwide. CPL was acquired by the
Japanese company “Outsourcing” in 2020 – an all-cash
deal worth €318 million, netting then-CEO and Longford
native Anne Heraty and her family €110 million.
Outsourcing made €23.9 million in profits in 2023,
financial documents show. For context, their current
client Meta made €1.305 billion through its Irish arm
in the same year. Covalen itself employs around 2,000
people in Sandyford working on the Meta project – with
almost all staff working five days a week in the office.
“When I complained to the [Senior Manager], I told them,
listen, you need to tell all your operational managers
and your TLs to treat all of us representatives like kings
and queens. And the [Senior Manager] was like, how
so? And I said, because your money comes from us. The
client is paying the headcount for the representatives,
not for the management, so your money is paid by the
company – and company money comes from us.” –
DATA-CWU Covalen Rep, Seminar 2025
As CWU delegates heard at our annual seminar in Dún
Laoghaire, workers in Covalen are a far cry from the
well-paid technology workers we often associate with
the sector. Your fellow members aren’t earning six-
figure salaries, nor do they relax on bean bags in the
break room while eating gourmet food. Instead, they
earn below the average industrial wage, repeatedly
have their bonuses denied based on excessive time
management metrics and code use, and face a toxic
culture of bullying, harassment, and a complete lack of
communication from management.
While Meta and Covalen rake in millions and even
billions in profit, your fellow members make a pittance
while dealing with constant disrespect, continual
changes to working conditions, and the steady erosion
of their limited benefits. As a Union, we were moved by
the bravery of our two representatives who took time
off work – despite concerns about job safety – to attend
the seminar and share their experiences in organising
for a better workplace.
This isn’t just a story of horrific conditions; it’s a
story of workers standing up, through their union, and
fighting together for something better.
Beginning with two angry members determined
to improve their workplace in January this year,
membership has sky-rocketed in just a few months.
Through a combination of one-to-one conversations,
phone calls, and in-person meetings, members and
CWU organisers increased Union membership to over
30 people, just from the initial stages – these numbers
continue to rise rapidly.
At seminar, our Covalen representatives spoke
of their struggles: the lack of a pay structure, no pay
rises, overbearing micromanagement through the use
of codes, and how the company has reduced their
“wellness time” – time meant to help workers cope with
the traumatic content they deal with, including sexual
violence and child abuse.
One representative shared how she and her
colleagues were already organising and standing up to
management before she ever spoke to a CWU organiser
on LinkedIn. After one particularly awful meeting with
management:
“We were like, no – I’m not taking that anymore.
And then we submitted a collective letter. We formed a
group on our internal work chat system. We had about
180 people and we signed the letter. Then I submitted
the letter to higher management. That day I was like,
‘Oh, now I need more protection.’ And then I joined the
Union.” – DATA-CWU Covalen Rep, Seminar 2025
Through this action, they won collective meetings with
management, who began making small concessions –
but no meaningful changes. The need for a strong union
was clear.
As frustration grew, workers were told their food
benefits were being cut. The company would no longer
provide breakfasts, lunches, or dinners – and even basic
tea and coffee provisions were withdrawn. For workers
hired with the promise of remote working, this cut
removed one of the few cost-of-living supports available
to them on already inadequate wages.
In response, Union membership more than doubled.
Members, with support from John and Shane,
developed and distributed a staff survey on the impact
of the cuts, gathering over 700 responses. They wrote a
letter to management, citing the results and widespread
anger. This forced management to backtrack partially,
reinstating one meal per day.
However, the quality of the meals was exceedingly
poor. Allergies weren’t accounted for, rice was
undercooked, and several workers reported falling ill.
So members kept organising.
After a series of weekend meetings hosted by
CWU organisers, members created a campaign plan,
elected their own committee, and began mapping the
workforce. They surveyed over 150 workers to reinforce
that food and low wages were the most pressing issues.
In mid-May, members released an open letter
demanding either the return of good-quality meals or
a €16 daily food allowance. The letter also called for
the election of a Worker Safety Representative, as set
out in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.
Staff were invited to sign the letter both to support the
demands and to elect a Union colleague to the Safety
Representative role.
Setting a target of 250 signatures, members surpassed
this in just two days. By day three, the letter had over
270 signatures, rising to more than 400 by the end of day
four. The election of a Safety Representative will finally
provide a formal channel for raising health and safety
concerns – from physical conditions in the office to food
safety and mental health risks – and allow meaningful
consultation as the Union continues to build its strength.
“I would say, because I’m a foreigner from Brazil,
and the majority of people that work for Covalen are
foreigners, we don’t really know our rights here. But
with the Union, we can have the right support and know
our rights.” – DATA-CWU Covalen Rep, Seminar 2025
CWU organisers John Bohan and Shane Murphy will
continue to support these members as they grow their
campaign in Covalen. As your Deputy General Secretary,
Ian McArdle, said at the seminar: “Power concedes
nothing without a struggle.”
We echo the words of our President, Frank Donohue,
who closed the Covalen discussion panel with a rousing
call to support these members in their fight for the
respect, conditions, and union rights many of us already
enjoy.
We still hear the echo of the standing ovation our
Covalen representatives received. To any Covalen
worker reading this: you have the full support of the
CWU as you continue building the workplace union
you need – one that can deliver the change you and
your colleagues deserve.",1389,"['content', 'moderation', 'worker', 'people', 'day', 'day', 'filter', 'worst', 'form', 'violence', 'abuse', 'might', 'otherwise', 'reach', 'phone', 'computer', 'train',

TELUS must respect the right to organize and bargain collectively,UNI Global,https://uniglobalunion.org/news/telus-must-respect-the-right-to-organize-and-bargain-collectively/,Demands,Union (or federation),Content moderators,"Canada, Turkey",08-01-2025,uni_2.txt,"﻿Today, on 1 August 2025, in Izmir, Türkiye, an international delegation – comprised of trade union representatives from Türkiye, Canada and multiple other countries, united under UNI Global Union – calls for an urgent, global dialogue with TELUS, the major Canadian multinational telecommunications and business services company. This united front marks the first step in our collective push for a global agreement that guarantees fundamental labour rights for all TELUS workers, no matter where they are.
TELUS’s growth has been powered by thousands of workers in customer service, technicians and outsourced operations worldwide. This growth must be matched by a strong commitment to labour rights, social justice and the dignity of the people who make its business possible.
Therefore, the undersigned trade unions call on TELUS to:
Fully recognize the right to organize and to bargain collectively in every country where the company operates, without interference, in accordance with the core conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO). Telus will abide by collective agreements in good faith. Telus will not engage in anti-union behaviour.
Establish effective and transparent procedures for resolving labour conflicts, through genuine dialogue and in good faith, avoiding any form of retaliation or repression against union activity.
Guarantee common minimum labour standards, including protection of physical and mental health, psychologically reasonable work metrics, decent wages, fair working conditions, job security and employment stability.
Protect union members from any form of discrimination or retaliation, ensuring they are free to organize, represent and negotiate on behalf of their co-workers.
We also raise our serious concerns about the situation in Türkiye, where TELUS has so far refused to recognize the trade union chosen by the workers. Union members and leaders report facing harassment and unfair dismissals simply for exercising their right to join a union. Such practices are unacceptable and contradict international labour standards.
In Canada, TELUS has been downsizing and outsourcing its Canadian operations with scant regard for the impact on workers or working conditions.
But we believe these issues can be remedied through constructive engagement. Through dialogue, we can develop binding commitments and ensure the same rights and protections for workers across the company’s operations.",357,"['today', '1', 'august', '2025', 'izmir', 'türkiye', 'international', 'delegation', 'comprised', 'trade', 'union', 'representative', 'türkiye', 'canada', 'multiple', 'country', 'united', 'uni', 'global', 'union', 'call', 'urgent', 'global', 'dialogue', 'telus', 'major', 'canadian', 'multinational', 'telecommunication', 'business', 'service', 'company', 'united', 'front', 'mark', 'first', 'step', 'collective', 'push', 'global', 'agreement', 'guarantee', 'fundamental', 'labour', 'right', 'telus', 'worker', 'matter', 'teluss', 'growth', 'powered', 'thousand', 'worker', 'customer', 'service', 'technician', 'outsourced', 'operation', 'worldwide', 'growth', 'must', 'matched', 'strong', 'commitment', 'labour', 'right', 'social', 'justice', 'dignity', 'people', 'make', 'business', 'possible', 'therefore', 'undersigned', 'trade', 'union', 'call', 'telus', 'fully', 'recognize', 'right', 'organize', 'bargain', 'collectively', 'every', 'country', 'company', 'operates', 'without', 'interference', 'accordance', 'core', 'convention', 'international', 'labour', 'organization', 'ilo', 'telus', 'abide', 'collective', 'agreement', 'good', 'faith', 'telus', 'engage', 'antiunion', 'behaviour', 'establish', 'effective', 'transparent', 'procedure', 'resolving', 'labour', 'conflict', 'genuine', 'dialogue', 'good', 'faith', 'avoiding', 'form', 'retaliation', 'repression', 'union', 'activity', 'guarantee', 'common', 'minimum', 'labour', 'standard', 'including', 'protection', 'physical', 'mental', 'health', 'psychologically', 'reasonable', 'work', 'metric', 'decent', 'wage', 'fair', 'working', 'condition', 'job', 'security', 'employment', 'stability', 'protect', 'union', 'member', 'form', 'discrimination', 'retaliation', 'ensuring', 'free', 'organize', 'represent', 'negotiate', 'behalf', 'coworkers', 'also', 'raise', 'serious', 'concern', 'situation', 'türkiye', 'telus', 'far', 'refused', 'recognize', 'trade', 'union', 'chosen', 'worker', 'union', 'member', 'leader', 'report', 'facing', 'harassment', 'unfair', 'dismissal', 'simply', 'exercising', 'right', 'join', 'union', 'practice', 'unacceptable', 'contradict', 'international', 'labour', 'standard', 'canada', 'telus', 'downsizing', 'outsourcing', 'canadian', 'operation', 'scant', 'regard', 'impact', 'worker', 'working', 'condition', 'believe', 'issue', 'remedied', 'constructive', 'engagement', 'dialogue', 'develop', 'binding', 'commitment', 'ensure', 'right', 'protection', 'worker', 'across', 'company', 'operation']",today 1 august 2025 izmir türkiye international delegation comprised trade union representative türkiye canada multiple country united uni global union call urgent global dialogue telus major canadian multinational telecommunication business service company united front mark first step collective push global agreement guarantee fundamental labour right telus worker matter teluss growth powered thousand worker customer service technician outsourced operation worldwide growth must matched strong commitment labour right social justice dignity people make business possible therefore undersigned trade union call telus fully recognize right organize bargain collectively every country company operates without interference accordance core convention international labour organization ilo telus abide collective agreement good faith telus engage antiunion behaviour establish effective transparent procedure resolving labour conflict genuine dialogue good faith avoiding form retaliation repression union activity guarantee common minimum labour standard including protection physical mental health psychologically reasonable work metric decent wage fair working condition job security employment stability protect union member form discrimination retaliation ensuring free organize represent negotiate behalf coworkers also raise serious concern situation türkiye telus far refused recognize trade union chosen worker union member leader report facing harassment unfair dismissal simply exercising right join union practice unacceptable contradict international labour standard canada telus downsizing outsourcing canadian operation scant regard impact worker working condition believe issue remedied constructive engagement dialogue develop binding commitment ensure right protection worker across company operation,"[-9.37803909e-02 -2.96557620e-02  4.62994240e-02 -1.26484986e-02

In-house data annotation best practice principles developed by MTI,MERL Tech,https://merltech.org/resources/in-house-data-annotation-best-practice-principles-developed-by-mti/,Principles,Industry,Data workers,Global,03-01-2025,merl.txt,"﻿On February 6th, the NLP Community of Practice’s Ethics & Governance Working Group convened to discuss the impact of AI development on the (human) workers involved in developing and refining Large Language Models (LLMs). We also wanted to highlight current thinking on what can be done to counteract the labour abuses currently baked into AI supply chains, emphasising that negative impacts can also occur at a smaller scale, for example when adapting LLMs in-house for ‘positive’ reasons such as improving relevance and safety. The recording and resources for this event can be found here. 
“The act of simplifying reality for a machine results in a great deal of complexity for the human.”
Our discussion kicked off with a brief overview of the role of humans in Large Language Model development, a topic highlighted by this in-depth expose as early as 2023 and which has now gained mainstream recognition. The ongoing role of human input is encapsulated by a comment from a source that noted wryly that “ChatGPT seems so human because it was trained by an AI that was mimicking humans who were rating an AI that was mimicking humans who were pretending to be a better version of an AI that was trained on human writing.”
Soma provided a useful metaphor: a parent teaching a child to talk by helping them associate sights, sounds, smells or sensations with certain words is much like the heart of the data annotation process. In AI terms, each time an association is made between, say, the image of a dog and the word/sound ‘dog’, a new ‘row’ of data is created. But because, despite what we may feel, AI is not nearly as adept as humans at learning independently, the data it is fed needs to be formatted in hyper-specific ways. This is a second way in which data annotators perform an invisible function: “AI has no methodology of exploring the world (…) so it’s not just pointing out that a picture means ‘mum’ or ‘dad’, it’s putting that association in a format that a computer will understand.”
These two steps alone represent one of the many ‘layers’ of data annotation that needs to take place to train an AI system. The additional stages are the equivalent of moving beyond individual word associations during our toddler years to understanding things like grammar and syntax as we develop. The role of data annotators as parents and teachers of AI, can’t be overstated – and this is entirely at odds with the poor working conditions many who do this work experience. 
The reality of data annotation for Global South Workers
Because of the significant human resources required to develop LLMs as powerful as ChatGPT and other commercial models, companies have yet again turned to the cheap workforces in LMICs – especially countries like Kenya, Uganda and India. These countries are specifically targeted because they often combine highly educated workforces with extremely high youth unemployment rates, as well as tax incentives and outdated or lax labour laws. Many young data workers are also lured by the promise of working on cutting edge technology, as Mophat highlighted: “I heard from my friends that AI is the future of technology, I wanted to be part of it – I was very curious about what AI is, and what it takes to train AI.” 
Unfortunately, the reality of the work was starkly at odds with the premise under which workers like Mophat were hired, by intermediaries such as Sama, themselves hired by organisations in the US recruiting anonymously on behalf of big commercial LLM companies. Firstly, Mophat’s dream of feeling part of something big and exciting, and opportunities to upskill in a cutting-edge field, were hindered by the fact that workers are provided with no context for the work they are doing, often given seemingly nonsensical tasks with no insight into how the task is feeding into a bigger picture. 
Additionally, the work itself was unreliable in terms of its frequency and duration, with projects starting and stopping at a moment’s notice, and either poorly paid, or unpaid, based on spurious reasons. More egregiously, Mophat talked of the mental and emotional toll of data annotation, which involved labelling images of abuse or violence – causing nightmares and affective issues with a worker’s children or family members. Even where organizations provide mental health support to workers, counsellors are not experienced enough in the impact of data-annotation induced trauma to provide adequate help.
This impact is not unique to commercial LLM supply chains. Maria, who is involved in data annotation to make a commercial LLM more safe and relevant for young female South African users of the Big Sis chatbot, also spoke of the huge weight of responsibility she and her colleagues have faced in making decisions as a ‘mother of AI’. Whereas Mophat spoke of feeling divorced from the impact of his work because of explicit efforts to keep workers in the dark, in-house data annotators can have an all-too strong connection to their work’s potential impact. 
For example, Maria spoke of the worry and guilt that could be caused by the knowledge that her decisions might end up directly shaping a GenAI powered response to, say, a young woman seeking help with the decision to terminate a pregnancy. Not only should this enormous responsibility be reflected in the status (and therefore pay) of data annotators, including at a smaller scale, but processes should also be put in place to prepare and support them to shoulder this burden on an ongoing basis. 
Frameworks and tools to assess and respond to labour abuses
Our discussion moved on to focus on what could be done to address these problematic issues – either when choosing which LLMs to work with, or when conducting data annotation in-house. 
Oǧuz spoke of the Fairwork action-research project, which aims to highlight the best and worst examples of how technology supply chains impact workers, and offers core principles developed in conversation with scholars, policy makers and workers themselves. These principles are then used to publicly hold companies accountable. To date, Fairwork has evaluated digital labour conditions in 40 countries and produced over 700 platform ratings including Uber, or JustEat as well as AI intermediary companies like Sama.
We also spoke of the delicate process of engaging with companies held up to scrutiny and doing justice to the demands and needs of workers they speak to. Oǧuz shared a case study involving Sama, the same company Mophat had worked for. Fairworks presented Sama with a ‘preliminary assessment’ based on desk research, interviews with workers and conversations with Sama managers. Two points were awarded for each of Fairwork’s 5 principles, based on issues such as unpaid overtime, short term contracts, dangerous levels of job strain and excessive workplace surveillance. Sama received a score of 0 out of 10. 
Sama showed willingness to engage and make changes, which did result in a 15% pay rise to the base salaries of almost 4,000 workers and improved access to psychological help – leading them to a score of 5 out of 10 (a 10/10 score is considered the ‘bare minimum’ in terms of rights-respecting workplace). Indeed, Mophat earlier mentioned that many Sama workers felt that the changes introduced by Sama were insufficient to merit a 5 out of 10. Oǧuz agreed with this and used it as an example to illustrate the importance of ongoing, repeated assessments on AI supply chains.
Ultimately, Oǧuz stressed Fairwork’s plan to move from evaluating intermediaries, including recruitment companies that handle the advertising and allocation of digital work like data annotation or content moderation, to holding the ‘lead firms’ accountable too. These large companies often hide their involvement via multiple layers of outsourcing. They, however, are the ones who ultimately define the working conditions through their budget stipulations, timeframes, limitations on workers’ rights via NDAs, and lack of upskilling opportunities. 
Calls to action to improve data annotation conditions
Fairwork’s global work will inevitably take time to move the needle, as it involves holding hugely powerful firms and complex systems accountable in a meaningful and enduring way. But closer to home, we may have more opportunities to improve working conditions for data annotators, starting with providing mental health support as standard. There is a tendency when working with new technologies to take a blank-slate approach, when actually what’s needed is a doubling-down on existing best practices when it comes to workers’ rights.
One simple step we can take is also to prioritise opportunities for education, upskilling, and certification. Mophat also stressed how important it is to educate workers not only about their rights but about the existence and benefits of organizing via trade unions such as Tech Worker Community Africa.  Data workers need to be made aware of their own value in terms of the crucial role they are playing in developing AI models which ultimately enrich a few billionaires in the Global North and be given recognition for the complex skills they have developed (from scratch!). Mophat mentioned how frequently data workers are left ‘stranded’ with nothing to show for their unique experiences.
  

In-house data annotation best practice principles developed by MTI
These final calls to action should be heard by those of us working directly with young people who may themselves be tempted by data annotation roles in their respective countries. It is becoming clearer and clearer that anyone involved in using an LLM to power their digital interventions has a responsibility to simultaneously educate their audience members on the risks associated with the wider phenomenon of AI – whether that means using it or participating in some way in its development.",1605,"['february', '6th', 'nlp', 'community', 'practice', 'ethic',
