Introduction
On a sunny afternoon in Nairobi, Kenya, a data worker receives
footage from a Roomba vacuum. The worker labels the objects
that the Roomba encounters, such as table legs and floor lamps,
in order to teach it to avoid obstacles, and identifies a carpet
so that the vacuum learns when it should apply greater suction.
Another data worker is given a one-minute pornographic video.
The worker types a list of 40 hashtags that describe the video
based on the characteristics of the actors–the color of their hair
or skin, the size and features of their bodies–so that the video
can be categorized for search results. A third data worker is
provided images of a murder victim at a crime scene. The worker
zooms into an image to trace the outline of a bullet wound and
a smashed skull, and labels them as such, to train AI to perform
post-mortem analyses. A final worker monitors reels on TikTok,
flagging user-generated content for infractions of the platform’s
terms, such as violent threats or graphic footage.
The seamless functionality of artificial intelligence and the
relative safety of online spaces are made possible by a vast,
often hidden, global workforce. Data labelers and content
moderators form the essential human infrastructure for the
world’s largest technology firms, performing critical tasks that
machines have not mastered. Labelers meticulously annotate
images, text, and videos–training the algorithms that power
everything from facial recognition and self-driving cars to
chatbots and recommendation engines. Content moderators
serve as the frontline guardians of online platforms–”digital
first responders”–reviewing vast quantities of user-generated
content to identify and remove harmful material, including hate
speech, misinformation, and graphic imagery. These workers
are fundamental to building trustworthy AI and maintaining
the integrity of the virtual world, yet their contributions are
undervalued and obscured from public view.
Introduction
This report focuses on data workers in a growing technology
hub: Nairobi, Kenya. Fueled by a young, educated, tech-savvy
population, a workforce with cultural and linguistic proficiency,
an economy with globally competitive labor costs, and
significant government efforts to lure tech-related investment,
Kenya has emerged as a center for digital labor. Thousands
of Kenyans are employed by business process outsourcing
companies (BPOs) or work for online labor platforms,
undertaking data annotation and content moderation on behalf
of major global corporations. A defining characteristic of the
digital economy, in Kenya and elsewhere, is the complex web of
outsourcing relationships. Major tech companies rarely employ
labelers or moderators directly. Instead, they contract the work
to large multinational BPOs or specialized platforms that, in
turn, often subcontract parts of the work to smaller, local BPOs
or use labor brokers to enlist workers from local labor markets.
The layers of subcontracting in digital supply chains create
opacity: workers at the end of the chain have no visibility into
the end client whose products they are building or safeguarding.
Outsourcing has profound impacts on working conditions, as
layers of intermediaries skim margins and make it difficult for
workers to hold lead firms accountable for labor violations or
poor treatment. This report sheds light on the experiences of
Kenyan data workers at the far reaches of digital supply chains
and offers recommendations based on workers’ desires for
improved working conditions.
Methodology and Sample
During July 2025, the Data Labellers Association administered
an in-person survey to digital supply chain workers in Kenya
to better understand their working conditions and the impacts
of this work on their wellbeing, yielding 226 valid surveys.
All survey responses are anonymous. The sample includes data
labellers (87%), content moderators (8%), and other digital
workers such as transcribers (5%). Of these respondents,
54% worked for online platforms and 46% were employed by
BPOs. Among the respondents who worked for BPOs, 19 firms
were represented.
In terms of educational attainment, 39% of respondents have
earned a bachelor’s degree, 39% have completed some university
studies, 22% have a high school diploma, and 1% have a master’s
degree. The top areas of study were computer science (22%),
engineering (11%), and business administration (10%).
More than one-quarter (28%) of respondents are age 20 to 25,
more than half (54%) are 26 to 31 years old, 17% are 32 to 37 years
old, and 2% are 38 years old or older (Figure 1).
Fifty-eight percent of respondents were men and 42%
were women.
All respondents were born in Kenya.
Outsourced Work in Digital Supply Chains
Leading global corporations, including technology firms, major
retailers, and online platforms, outsource essential data tasks
like content moderation and AI training to BPOs and digital
labor platforms. These BPOs and platforms manage global
workforces of data workers who perform tasks according to the
end clients’ specifications, while workers have little insight into
who their work benefits and how it will be used.
While most data workers opt to work for either a BPO or a
platform, 23% of workers surveyed are working for both a BPO
and a platform, an indication of workers’ attempts to diversify
income sources and increase their take-home pay.
Workers hired by BPOs are likely to have an employment
contract with their employer (82%). Yet one quarter of those
workers say they do not understand everything in their
contract. Nearly all (93%) of BPO workers are asked to sign a
non-disclosure agreement as a condition of employment, which
can have consequences for speaking out about substandard
conditions or other workplace challenges.
Platform workers are far less likely than those employed by
BPOs to have a contract with the platform they use most
frequently (26%), and of those, two-thirds (67%) do not
understand everything in their contract. Contract documents
can be lengthy and use legal language unfamiliar to workers.
Thirty-four percent of platform workers report being asked to
sign a non-disclosure agreement.
Non-payment of work is a common issue: more than half
of platform workers (53%) report that, in the past year, they
have done platform work and not been paid for the tasks they
completed. Workers report tasks being rejected, often with no
explanation, account deactivation without notice or recourse,
and waiting long periods between task completion and payment.
Lack of payment and delayed payment can have substantial
impacts on workers’ financial insecurity, a topic we turn to next.
Data Workers Face Mounting Financial Hardships
Despite playing a critical role in the digital economy, many data
workers face persistent financial hardships. With inadequate
job security and compensation well below a living wage, they
struggle to meet basic needs, including paying for housing,
healthcare, and education and childcare, even as their labor fuels
the development of cutting-edge technologies. This disconnect
between the value of their contributions and their economic
personal realities underscores the growing inequality in digital
supply-chain labor markets.

When asked whether in the
past two months they were
able to comfortably cover
their housing costs, the vast
majority of respondents–69%
–indicated that they are not
able to do so (Figure 2).
Nearly three in four
respondents (73%) reported
that in the past two months,
they were not able to
comfortably cover childcare
or school fees (Figure 3).

When asked whether in the
past two months they were
able to comfortably cover the
costs of their medications
and medical fees, 59% of
respondents indicated that
they are not able to do so
(Figure 4).
Nearly half of respondents
(47%) reported that over the
past two months, they were not
able to comfortably afford the
cost of food (Figure 5).
Because of the challenges data
workers face in covering the
costs of basic necessities, many
also face difficulties paying for
work-related expenses. Nearly
half (47%) indicated that in the
past two months, they were
not able to comfortably cover
the costs of internet service
(Figure 6), and 55% were not
able to comfortably cover their
transportation costs (Figure 7).

Health Risks for Data Workers
Impacts of Working as a Data Worker
on Physical Health
Data work poses significant physical and mental health risks
to workers. Many data annotators and content moderators
experience isolation, inadequate support from their employer,
and burnout. Physically, both roles involve prolonged
sedentary periods staring at screens, which can lead to eye
strain, headaches, repetitive injuries such as carpal tunnel
syndrome, and musculoskeletal disorders resulting from poor
ergonomics. While 54% of survey respondents report that
working as a data worker has had no impact on their physical
health, 36% report a negative impact, and just 9% report a
positive impact (Figure 8). By far, the leading negative impact
is degraded eyesight and eye strain as a result of prolonged
screen time, followed by back pain that comes from sitting for
extended periods.
Mentally, the impacts of
data work can be severe,
particularly for content
moderators who are regularly
exposed to graphic, violent,
or disturbing material. Data
annotators, depending on the
project, also face psychological
risks, while even mundane
annotation tasks can lead to
fatigue and low morale due
to repetition and pressure to
intensify the pace of work.
The survey finds that 48% of
data annotators report that
working as a data worker has
had no impact on their mental
health, 27% report a negative
impact, and 25% report a
positive impact (Figure 9).10 Health Risks for Data Workers
figure 9 Impacts of Working as a Data Worker on
Mental Health
The most commonly reported
negative impacts are
insomnia, anxiety, stress, and
depression. Underreporting is
common with mental health
issues, given the continued
stigma surrounding
psychological challenges, so
these are likely conservative
estimates. The sample size of
content moderators is too
small to allow for separate
analysis, but we believe the
prevalence of negative mental
health impacts is considerably
higher among content
moderators.
Eighteen percent of data workers report having to repeatedly
view content that was violent or disturbing, and the vast
majority (80%) report that viewing disturbing content caused
them to experience negative feelings. Many workers keep
these feelings to themselves, lacking a person with whom they
feel comfortable sharing such difficult experiences. Workers
report that some employers (41%) offer what they call “wellness
coaches” to support workers, but many workers say they fear
that the information they share will be used against them.
Others lack confidence that talking with a wellness coach
would be helpful.11 Data Worker Demands
Data workers are essential to the functioning of today’s
digital economy, yet many continue to face low pay, insecure
employment, and health challenges related to their work.
In response, data workers are developing an employer code
of conduct that affirms workers’ right to fair treatment
and dignified labor. This includes improvements in pay that
reflect the value of their contributions, reasonable working
hours and predictable scheduling, transparent and secure
contracts, and access to essential benefits such as mental health
and medical care. These standards are not only a matter of
fairness—they are foundational to building a more ethical and
sustainable digital economy.
Survey respondents identified four key components of more
fair and equitable employment. The first concerns pay: the most
commonly cited desire is changes in pay standards, principally
the need to raise pay rates. As the survey data showing
widespread financial hardships makes clear, data workers in
Kenya routinely struggle to cover their basic living expenses.
Employment insecurity is a reality for many, if not most, data
workers in Kenya. Because of this, a second key demand is the
adoption of longer-tenure, legally binding contracts written
in language workers understand. Many data workers operate
as independent contractors or through layers of subcontracting,
which strips them of job security, benefits, and avenues
for recourse against substandard working conditions. This
precariousness contributes to a constant sense of instability
and pressure to accept any available work, regardless of its
impact on workers’ well-being.12 Data Worker Demands
Relatedly, respondents called for revisions to company
policies governing work hours. This includes calls to reduce
the required number of work hours, allowances for greater
working time flexibility, and the easing of deadlines that require
overly long workdays. Data annotators often face sporadic
work schedules, ambiguous task instructions, and constant
performance monitoring. Mistakes can lead to immediate
loss of income or access to future assignments. Data workers
are employed in high-pressure environments, often under
conditions that are physically, psychologically, and emotionally
taxing. Underlying the demand to alter scheduling practices is
the need to alleviate some of the work stresses that have been so
debilitating for the workforce.
In recognition of the physical and mental hardships faced by
data workers, a fourth demand concerns the need for companies
to provide better mental health counseling as well as medical
insurance. Data workers involved in content moderation
are frequently exposed to graphic and disturbing material—
such as violence, hate speech, and sexual abuse—at a rapid pace,
sometimes reviewing hundreds of items per day. This has led
to widespread reports of trauma, depression, and substance
abuse among workers, especially in outsourced operations.
Companies in the digital economy bear some responsibility for
the harmful exposures to which workers are subjected, and they
must do more to safeguard their well-being. Harms could be at
least partially mitigated by (a) contracts that provide greater
transparency about work tasks and ensure workers’ informed
consent to undertake these tasks, (b) a more robust support
infrastructure that helps workers cope with the emotional toll
of these tasks, and (c) more worker-friendly scheduling that
eases the burdens associated with intense periods of exposure
to harmful material.
