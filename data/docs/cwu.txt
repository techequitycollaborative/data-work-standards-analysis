It’s content moderation workers – the people who, day
in and day out, filter out the worst forms of violence
and abuse that might otherwise reach your phones and
computers. They train AI programmes so that these
systems don’t return answers that support violent or
abusive acts, or generate content along those lines.
When it comes to Facebook, Instagram, and
WhatsApp – social media tools owned by the tech
multinational Meta – this work in Ireland is carried out
by workers who have joined DATA-CWU and begun to
build their own union in a company called Covalen.
These union members are the guardians of the internet
as you experience it through these Meta applications.
The workforce is extremely diverse, coming from a
wide range of backgrounds, ages, races, nationalities,
genders, and sexualities – with most workers not
originally from Ireland. Many are on work visas, and
the vast majority spend most of their salaries on
Dublin rents. CWU Organisers John Bohan and Shane
Murphy have been supporting members in Covalen
to build the power they need to improve conditions
in their workplace and win the respect they deserve.
Membership is increasing at quick and consistent pace
as workers come together to stand up for what’s right.
“How can I say without blowing into the details?
Probably some of you already watch the Dexter series
on Netflix, or the Jeffrey Dahmer documentary. Yeah, so
if you saw that documentary, you know our job. We are
exposed to this kind of content – but 100 times more
disturbing.” – DATA-CWU Covalen Rep, Seminar 2025
Covalen is a subsidiary of the Irish company CPL,
which provides temporary and permanent staff to the
technology, accounting and finance, sales, engineering,
light industrial, healthcare, pharmaceutical, and office
admin sectors. It employs over 13,000 people across
around 45 offices worldwide. CPL was acquired by the
Japanese company “Outsourcing” in 2020 – an all-cash
deal worth €318 million, netting then-CEO and Longford
native Anne Heraty and her family €110 million.
Outsourcing made €23.9 million in profits in 2023,
financial documents show. For context, their current
client Meta made €1.305 billion through its Irish arm
in the same year. Covalen itself employs around 2,000
people in Sandyford working on the Meta project – with
almost all staff working five days a week in the office.
“When I complained to the [Senior Manager], I told them,
listen, you need to tell all your operational managers
and your TLs to treat all of us representatives like kings
and queens. And the [Senior Manager] was like, how
so? And I said, because your money comes from us. The
client is paying the headcount for the representatives,
not for the management, so your money is paid by the
company – and company money comes from us.” –
DATA-CWU Covalen Rep, Seminar 2025
As CWU delegates heard at our annual seminar in Dún
Laoghaire, workers in Covalen are a far cry from the
well-paid technology workers we often associate with
the sector. Your fellow members aren’t earning six-
figure salaries, nor do they relax on bean bags in the
break room while eating gourmet food. Instead, they
earn below the average industrial wage, repeatedly
have their bonuses denied based on excessive time
management metrics and code use, and face a toxic
culture of bullying, harassment, and a complete lack of
communication from management.
While Meta and Covalen rake in millions and even
billions in profit, your fellow members make a pittance
while dealing with constant disrespect, continual
changes to working conditions, and the steady erosion
of their limited benefits. As a Union, we were moved by
the bravery of our two representatives who took time
off work – despite concerns about job safety – to attend
the seminar and share their experiences in organising
for a better workplace.
This isn’t just a story of horrific conditions; it’s a
story of workers standing up, through their union, and
fighting together for something better.
Beginning with two angry members determined
to improve their workplace in January this year,
membership has sky-rocketed in just a few months.
Through a combination of one-to-one conversations,
phone calls, and in-person meetings, members and
CWU organisers increased Union membership to over
30 people, just from the initial stages – these numbers
continue to rise rapidly.
At seminar, our Covalen representatives spoke
of their struggles: the lack of a pay structure, no pay
rises, overbearing micromanagement through the use
of codes, and how the company has reduced their
“wellness time” – time meant to help workers cope with
the traumatic content they deal with, including sexual
violence and child abuse.
One representative shared how she and her
colleagues were already organising and standing up to
management before she ever spoke to a CWU organiser
on LinkedIn. After one particularly awful meeting with
management:
“We were like, no – I’m not taking that anymore.
And then we submitted a collective letter. We formed a
group on our internal work chat system. We had about
180 people and we signed the letter. Then I submitted
the letter to higher management. That day I was like,
‘Oh, now I need more protection.’ And then I joined the
Union.” – DATA-CWU Covalen Rep, Seminar 2025
Through this action, they won collective meetings with
management, who began making small concessions –
but no meaningful changes. The need for a strong union
was clear.
As frustration grew, workers were told their food
benefits were being cut. The company would no longer
provide breakfasts, lunches, or dinners – and even basic
tea and coffee provisions were withdrawn. For workers
hired with the promise of remote working, this cut
removed one of the few cost-of-living supports available
to them on already inadequate wages.
In response, Union membership more than doubled.
Members, with support from John and Shane,
developed and distributed a staff survey on the impact
of the cuts, gathering over 700 responses. They wrote a
letter to management, citing the results and widespread
anger. This forced management to backtrack partially,
reinstating one meal per day.
However, the quality of the meals was exceedingly
poor. Allergies weren’t accounted for, rice was
undercooked, and several workers reported falling ill.
So members kept organising.
After a series of weekend meetings hosted by
CWU organisers, members created a campaign plan,
elected their own committee, and began mapping the
workforce. They surveyed over 150 workers to reinforce
that food and low wages were the most pressing issues.
In mid-May, members released an open letter
demanding either the return of good-quality meals or
a €16 daily food allowance. The letter also called for
the election of a Worker Safety Representative, as set
out in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.
Staff were invited to sign the letter both to support the
demands and to elect a Union colleague to the Safety
Representative role.
Setting a target of 250 signatures, members surpassed
this in just two days. By day three, the letter had over
270 signatures, rising to more than 400 by the end of day
four. The election of a Safety Representative will finally
provide a formal channel for raising health and safety
concerns – from physical conditions in the office to food
safety and mental health risks – and allow meaningful
consultation as the Union continues to build its strength.
“I would say, because I’m a foreigner from Brazil,
and the majority of people that work for Covalen are
foreigners, we don’t really know our rights here. But
with the Union, we can have the right support and know
our rights.” – DATA-CWU Covalen Rep, Seminar 2025
CWU organisers John Bohan and Shane Murphy will
continue to support these members as they grow their
campaign in Covalen. As your Deputy General Secretary,
Ian McArdle, said at the seminar: “Power concedes
nothing without a struggle.”
We echo the words of our President, Frank Donohue,
who closed the Covalen discussion panel with a rousing
call to support these members in their fight for the
respect, conditions, and union rights many of us already
enjoy.
We still hear the echo of the standing ovation our
Covalen representatives received. To any Covalen
worker reading this: you have the full support of the
CWU as you continue building the workplace union
you need – one that can deliver the change you and
your colleagues deserve.
