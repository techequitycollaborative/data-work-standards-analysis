In cases where rejection mechanisms exist for delivered work:
Workers should be able to contest rejection decisions. Workers receive a clear and reasonable explanation for any rejections

1. As a guideline for ensuring non-payment is not an option, see criteria developed by Harmon and Silberman in
their 2018 ‘Rating working conditions on digital labour platforms’, as follows:
In cases where rejection mechanisms exist for delivered work:
Workers should be able to contest rejection decisions. Workers receive a clear and reasonable explanation for any rejections
Workers may attempt to redo rejected work at least once
If the worker contests the rejection decision, the case is reviewed (a second time) by a neutral third party,
who makes a binding decision; the platform agrees not to punish the worker in any way if the third party
decides in favor of the worker
If the work is rejected it is not able to be used by the client.",0.3750099837779999,11

1. Limit the number of rejections the platform will allow to affect a
worker’s approval rate when a requester rejects all work (i.e. 10
rejections per day would affect the approval rating, the others would, of
course, still be rejected, but only the first 10 would affect the worker’s
rating.)",0.22856053709983826,0

young people who may themselves be tempted by data annotation roles in their

an LLM to power their digital interventions has a responsibility to simultaneously

Event recap: Humans in the
machine – the impact of AI on
workers
On February 6th, the NLP Community of Practice’s Ethics & Governance Working
Group convened to discuss the impact of AI development on the (human) workers
involved in developing and refining Large Language Models (LLMs). We also wanted to
highlight current thinking on what can be done to counteract the labour abuses
currently baked into AI supply chains, emphasising that negative impacts can also
occur at a smaller scale, for example when adapting LLMs in-house for ‘positive’
reasons such as improving relevance and safety. The recording and resources for this
event can be found here.",0.364612877368927,0

Internet Institute, who have developed an assessment framework and
guidance for evaluating the labour conditions of data platforms, including
LLMs. “The act of simplifying reality for a
machine results in a great deal of
complexity for the human.”
Our discussion kicked off with a brief overview of the role of humans in Large
Language Model development, a topic highlighted by this in-depth expose as early
as 2023 and which has now gained mainstream recognition. The ongoing role of
human input is encapsulated by a comment from a source that noted wryly that
“ChatGPT seems so human because it was trained by an AI that was mimicking
humans who were rating an AI that was mimicking humans who were pretending to be
a be$er version of an AI that was trained on human writing.”
Soma provided a useful metaphor: a parent teaching a child to talk by helping them
associate sights, sounds, smells or sensations with certain words is much like the
heart of the data annotation process.",0.35577312111854553,3

workers not only about their rights but about the existence and benefits of
organizing via trade unions such as Tech Worker Community Africa. Data workers
need to be made aware of their own value in terms of the crucial role they are playing
in developing AI models which ultimately enrich a few billionaires in the Global North
